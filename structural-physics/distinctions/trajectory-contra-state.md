# Trajectory contra State

## Distinction

**Trajectory contra State** names the distinction between dynamic orientation and static condition within the Zenetist framework.

**Trajectory** refers to the continuous motion of a being, universe, or pattern through structural space. It is defined by directional evolution across time and orientation, formalized in Structural Physics by functions such as \( \chi(\tau) \). Trajectory is not a position but a path.

**State** refers to a fixed configuration or momentary condition within structure. A state may be described by parameters at a given instant, but does not by itself capture the direction or necessity of motion.

Thus:

- Trajectory expresses motion.
- State describes configuration.
- Trajectory is ontological movement.
- State is structural snapshot.

In Zenetism, universes do not exist as states; they exist as trajectories.  
States are intelligible only as cross-sections of motion.

## Formal Distinction

\[
\text{State} = U(\tau_0)
\]

\[
\text{Trajectory} = U : \tau \mapsto U(\tau)
\]

\[
\chi \;\text{belongs to trajectory, not state}
\]

---

## Canonical Formulation

State belongs to structure.  
Trajectory belongs to motion.

A state can be described.  
A trajectory must be followed.

Therefore, existence is not a position in reality,  
but a path through it.
