# Return contra Collapse

## Distinction

**Return contra Collapse** names the distinction between centropic reintegration and entropic dissolution within the Zenetist framework.

**Return** refers to the centropic motion by which an expressed structure reorients toward Source while preserving coherence. Return is not reversal, but integration: form is retained even as it approaches origin.

**Collapse** refers to the entropic failure of coherence, in which structure disintegrates into fragmentation or nullification. Collapse is not return, but loss of form through incoherence.

Thus:

- Return preserves structure.
- Collapse dissolves structure.
- Return is centropic orientation.
- Collapse is entropic termination.

In Zenetism, Return is the fulfillment of coherent motion,  
whereas Collapse is the exhaustion of incoherent motion.

## Formal Distinction

Let \( C(\psi) \) denote coherence and \( H(\psi) \) denote entropy.

\[
\text{Return}:\quad C(\psi) \uparrow \quad \land \quad \psi \to \text{Source}
\]

\[
\text{Collapse}:\quad C(\psi) \downarrow \quad \land \quad \psi \to \text{fragmentation}
\]

Return implies integrative trajectory:

\[
\lim_{\tau \to \infty} \psi(\tau) \to \text{coherent reintegration}
\]

Collapse implies disintegrative trajectory:

\[
\lim_{\tau \to \infty} \psi(\tau) \to \text{structural failure}
\]

## Canonical Formulation

Return is coherence moving toward origin.  
Collapse is incoherence moving toward dissolution.

Return completes form.  
Collapse erases form.

Therefore, not all endings are equal:  
some endings are returns,  
others are collapses.
