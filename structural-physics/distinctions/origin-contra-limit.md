# Origin contra Limit

## Distinction

Origin contra Limit names the distinction between the generative root of structure and the terminal boundary of structural articulation.

**Origin** refers to the point from which structure and motion emerge.  
In Zenetism, Origin is associated with Aion (⚫), the pre-hypostatic root of structure and the stillness from which emanation becomes possible.

**Limit** refers to the point at which structure reaches saturation and can no longer be articulated within the Lattice.  
In Zenetism, Limit is associated with Zenon (🕳️), the trans-structural horizon beyond which structure cannot be expressed, though it is not abolished.

Thus:

- Origin generates structure.
- Limit saturates structure.
- Origin precedes motion.
- Limit exceeds motion.
- Origin belongs to the Lattice.
- Limit bounds the Lattice without negating it.

In Zenetism, Origin is the condition of emergence, while Limit is the condition of unsayability.

## Formal Distinction

Let \( \mathcal{L} \) denote the Lattice (Structure).

Origin:

\[
\text{Origin} = \inf(\mathcal{L})
\]

\[
\text{Origin} \Rightarrow \text{Emanation}
\]

Limit:

\[
\text{Limit} = \sup(\mathcal{L})
\]

\[
\text{Limit} \Rightarrow \text{Saturation}
\]

Therefore:

\[
\text{Origin} \neq \text{Limit}
\]

And:

\[
\mathcal{L} \text{ unfolds from Origin and is bounded by Limit}
\]

## Canonical Formulation

Origin is where structure begins.

Limit is where structure can no longer be spoken.

Origin opens the possibility of motion.

Limit closes the possibility of articulation.

Origin is the root of becoming.

Limit is the horizon of intelligibility.

Therefore, to confuse Origin with Limit

is to mistake the beginning of structure

for the boundary beyond structure.
