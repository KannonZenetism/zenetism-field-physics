# CP₀ contra CP₁

## Distinction

**CP₀ contra CP₁** names the distinction between pre-expressive convergence and expressive equilibrium within the Zenetist framework.

**CP₀ (Pre-Expressive Convergence)** refers to the closure of requisites prior to motion. In CP₀, Zero and Infinity converge without fusion, polarity, or orientation. There is structure without expression and essence without χ. CP₀ is stable because motion has not yet emerged.

**CP₁ (Expressive Equilibrium)** refers to co-expression within motion, where centropic and entropic forces are balanced at \( \chi = 1 \). Unlike CP₀, CP₁ exists within polarity and χ-dynamics. It is admissible as a limit condition but unstable as a persistent state.

Thus:

- CP₀ precedes motion.
- CP₁ occurs within motion.
- CP₀ contains no orientation.
- CP₁ exists within orientation.
- CP₀ is structurally stable.
- CP₁ is dynamically unstable.

## Formal Distinction

\[
\text{CP}_0 \;\notin\; \chi\text{-space}
\]

\[
\text{CP}_1 \;\in\; \chi\text{-space}
\]

\[
\text{CP}_0 \;=\; \text{convergence without motion}
\]

\[
\text{CP}_1 \;=\; \text{equilibrium within motion}
\]

## Canonical Formulation

CP₀ belongs to structure before motion.  
CP₁ belongs to motion within structure.

CP₀ is convergence without polarity.  
CP₁ is balance within polarity.

CP₀ is stable because motion has not begun.  
CP₁ is unstable because motion cannot sustain perfect symmetry.
