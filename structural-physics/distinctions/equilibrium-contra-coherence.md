# Equilibrium contra Coherence

## Distinction

**Equilibrium contra Coherence** names the distinction between balanced expression and lawful structural integration within the Zenetist framework.

**Equilibrium** refers to a condition in which centropic and entropic forces are balanced within motion.  
Equilibrium is a state of symmetry within expression, not a guarantee of stability or meaning.

**Coherence** refers to the lawful integration of structure across layers of the lattice.  
Coherence is not balance, but alignment: a state in which structure remains internally consistent, oriented, and intelligible.

Thus:

- Equilibrium is expressive balance.
- Coherence is structural integrity.
- Equilibrium concerns motion.
- Coherence concerns structure.

In Zenetism, equilibrium may occur without coherence,  
but coherence cannot exist without structure.

## Formal Distinction

Let \( C(\psi) \) denote coherence and \( E(\psi) \) denote entropic tendency.

**Equilibrium:**

\[
C(\psi) \approx E(\psi)
\]

**Coherence:**

\[
\frac{dC(\psi)}{d\tau} \geq 0 \quad \land \quad \psi \text{ remains structurally integrated}
\]

Equilibrium does not imply coherence:

\[
C(\psi) \approx E(\psi) \;\not\Rightarrow\; \text{Coherence}
\]

But coherence implies structural orientation:

\[
\text{Coherence} \Rightarrow \chi \neq 1 \text{ as a permanent state}
\]

Therefore:

\[
\text{Equilibrium} \neq \text{Coherence}
\]

## Canonical Formulation

Equilibrium is balance within motion.  
Coherence is integrity within structure.

Equilibrium can exist without meaning.  
Coherence is the condition of meaning.

Equilibrium may be stable or unstable.  
Coherence is always lawful or lost.

Therefore, to confuse equilibrium with coherence  
is to mistake symmetry of forces  
for veracity of structure.
