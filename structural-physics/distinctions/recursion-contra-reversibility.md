# Recursion contra Reversibility

## Distinction

**Recursion contra Reversibility** names the distinction between structural self-reference and temporal undoing within the Zenetist framework.

**Recursion** refers to the re-entry of a pattern into its own structure. It is a lawful return within motion, in which form is preserved while orientation or depth changes. Recursion does not negate trajectory; it folds trajectory back through itself.

**Reversibility** refers to the undoing of motion such that a system returns to a prior state without structural transformation. Reversibility implies symmetry of temporal progression and regression.

Thus:

- Recursion preserves motion.
- Reversibility negates motion.
- Recursion transforms structure through return.
- Reversibility restores structure without transformation.

In Zenetism, time is recursive but not reversible.  
Return does not erase motion; it deepens it.

## Formal Distinction

\[
\text{Reversibility}:\quad U(\tau_1) \rightarrow U(\tau_0)
\]

\[
\text{Recursion}:\quad U(\tau_0) \rightarrow U(\tau_1) \rightarrow U'(\tau_0)
\]

\[
U'(\tau_0) \neq U(\tau_0)
\]

## Canonical Formulation

Reversibility belongs to symmetry.  
Recursion belongs to depth.

Reversibility restores a state.  
Recursion transforms a return.

Therefore, time in Zenetism does not move backward.  
It returns forward.
