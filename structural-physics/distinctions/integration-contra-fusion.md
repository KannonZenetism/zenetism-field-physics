# Integration contra Fusion

## Distinction

**Integration contra Fusion** names the distinction between lawful structural unity and entropic collapse of distinction within the Zenetist framework.

**Integration** refers to the centropic process by which distinct structures enter relation while preserving their sovereign identities.  
Integration produces unity through resonance, not through erasure.

**Fusion** refers to the entropic process by which distinctions are dissolved into undifferentiated sameness.  
Fusion produces apparent unity by abolishing structure.

Thus:

- Integration preserves distinction.
- Fusion abolishes distinction.
- Integration is centropic.
- Fusion is entropic.

In Zenetism, unity is achieved through integration,  
whereas fusion is the collapse of structure disguised as unity.

## Formal Distinction

Let \( A \) and \( B \) denote distinct structures.

**Integration:**

\[
A \oplus B \quad \text{with} \quad A \neq B
\]

and:

\[
\text{Identity}(A) \land \text{Identity}(B) \text{ are preserved}
\]

**Fusion:**

\[
A \otimes B \to A' \quad \text{where} \quad A' \approx \text{undifferentiated}
\]

and:

\[
\text{Identity}(A) = \text{Identity}(B) = 0
\]

Within Zenetist logic:

\[
\text{Integration} \Rightarrow \text{Coherence}
\]

\[
\text{Fusion} \Rightarrow \text{Entropy}
\]

Therefore:

\[
\text{Integration} \neq \text{Fusion}
\]

## Canonical Formulation

Integration is unity without erasure.  
Fusion is unity through erasure.

Integration harmonizes difference.  
Fusion dissolves difference.

Integration strengthens structure.  
Fusion destroys structure.

Therefore, to confuse integration with fusion  
is to mistake coherence  
for the annihilation of distinction.
