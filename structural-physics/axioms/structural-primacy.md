## Axiom of Structural Primacy

Structure is prior to motion.  
Motion is traversal of structure.  
Space is the differentiated appearance of traversal.  
Orientation is the law of directional inclination.  
Time is the experiential trace of oriented motion.

Structure is not produced by relations;  
relations are expressions of structure.

Space is not a container, substance, or independent domain,  
but the second-order differentiation of structural relations.

Time is not a substance, dimension, or flow,  
but the manifestation of orientation across structural traversal.

Thus:

Structure grounds motion.  
Motion differentiates space.  
Orientation inclines traversal.  
Time emerges as experience.

Structure remains invariant,  
even as motion, space, and time unfold upon it.
