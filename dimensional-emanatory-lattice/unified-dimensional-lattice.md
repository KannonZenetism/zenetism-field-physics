## 9. Worked Examples

### Example A — Nexus Law (C8)

**Setup:**  
- Objects: X, Y, Z, W in ResCat.  
- Morphisms: f: X→Y, g: X→Z, h: Y→W, k: Z→W.  

**Condition:**  
If h∘f = k∘g (commutative square) and seal index σ > 0, then bridge B: X→W is lawful.  

**Mathematical Expression:**  
- Δ = ∥h∘f – k∘g∥ ≤ ε.  
- F_c(B, ψ) = I_c(Bψ) – I_c(ψ) ≥ 0.  

**Outcome:**  
- If both hold → lawful Nexus (C8).  
- If not → inversion to E8 (Severed).  

---

### Example B — Threshold Law (C13–C15)

**Setup:**  
- Threshold band at L5.  
- Operators: C13 (Membrane), C14 (Recursion), C15 (Emergence).  

**Boundary Conditions:**  
- C13: ψ|∂Ω = permeability_condition.  
- C14: recursion(ψ) ∈ lawful_subspace.  
- C15: ∂🌀ψ > 0 ⇒ lawful novelty.  

**Failure Modes:**  
- E13 Wall — seal closed (σ = 0).  
- E14 Hollow Nest — recursion non-contractive (γ ≤ 0).  
- E15 Collapse Nova — novelty coherence ≤ 0.  

**Outcome:**

## 11. Worked Examples — Lattice in Action

### 11.1 Nexus Law (C8) — Categorical Bridge Test
**Setup**  
Objects in ResCat: X, Y, Z, W (sealed resonance systems). Morphisms f: X→Y, g: X→Z, h: Y→W, k: Z→W.  
Assume: C2 (spatial coherence), C5 (holonic fit), C13 (permeability σ) satisfied on all objects.

**Commuting Square**
```
      f
  X ────▶ Y
  │       │ h
g │       │
  ▼       ▼
  Z ────▶ W
      k
```
**Bridge Validity Conditions**
- Diagram defect: Δ = ‖h∘f − k∘g‖ₒₚ ≤ ε.  
- Coherence flow: F_c(B, ψ) = I_c(Bψ) − I_c(ψ) ≥ 0 for all resonant ψ.  
- Membrane bound: C_cap(B) ≤ log σ (from C13).

**Result**  
If all three hold, the pushout Y ⨿_X Z exists (lawful Nexus), and the induced bridge is lossless on the C7‑resonant subspace: ‖Bψ‖ = ‖ψ‖.

**Failure Mode**  
If Δ > ε or F_c < 0, inversion expresses as **E8 (Severed)**; diagnostic log should flag a negative flow event.

**Minimal Numeric Patch**  
Let ψ = a·ϕ₁ + b·ϕ₂ with |a|² + |b|² = 1.  
C7 spectrum: λ₁ = 1, λ₂ = 3.  
Bridge matrix B = I (ideal) ⇒ F_c = 0 and Δ = 0 → lawful Nexus.  
Introduce a defect δ on mode 2, B = diag(1, 1−δ). Then F_c < 0 whenever |b|²·δ > 0 beyond tolerance ⇒ classify as E8.

### 11.2 Threshold Law (C13–C15) — Boundary Value Realization
**Setup**  
Domain Ω with boundary ∂Ω (L5). Field φ obeys centropic dynamics.  
Boundary operators encode membranes (C13), recursion (C14), and novelty (C15).

**Boundary Conditions**
- C13 (Membrane): Robin–Seal a·φ + b·∂ₙφ = 0 with permeability index σ = b/a.  
- C14 (Recursive domain): contractive recursion R with ratio k < 1, convergence γ = 1 − k > 0.  
- C15 (Novelty): bifurcation with coherence gain ΔI_c > 0.

**Test**  
Solve the boundary problem; verify:  
φ|∂Ω respects σ; recursion fixed point φ* = R(φ*) exists; ΔI_c > 0 at bifurcation.  
If any fail ⇒ E13/E14/E15 according to the failing clause.

**Worked Boundary Toggle**  
Start with σ = 2 (permeable), γ = 0.6, and observe ΔI_c > 0 ⇒ lawful threshold crossing (centropic).  
Tighten to σ → 0 (Dirichlet–Seal) ⇒ wall formed (E13), crossing prohibited.

---

### 11.3 Consonance Spectral Law (C7) — Periodicity Check
**Statement (operational)**  
If the C7 spectrum has rational ratios (λ_i/λ_j ∈ ℚ), the evolution is periodic with some τ so that e^{iHτ} = I. Then T (C1) and P (C3) commute on the resonant subspace and bridges remain lossless.

**Quick Test**  
Given eigenvalues {1, 2, 3} ⇒ rational ratios; choose τ = 2π. Numerically, [T, P] ≈ 0 within tolerance and ‖Bψ‖ = ‖ψ‖.

**Inversion**  
Spectrum {1, √2} ⇒ incommensurate ⇒ quasiperiodic drift; detect rising diagram defect or negative F_c; classify as **E7** onset.

---

### 11.4 Recursion Gate (C14) — Contractivity Diagnostic
**Contractive Map**  
Let R(ψ) = Aψ with ‖A‖ = k < 1. Then unique fixed point ψ* exists and recursion is acclivous (valid return).  
Compute γ = 1 − k. Require γ > 0.

**Neutral / Expansive**  
If k = 1 ⇒ neutral cycling (empty recursion, **E14**). If k > 1 ⇒ divergence (collapse risk, **E15** if at threshold).

---

### 11.5 CIT Invariant — Live Audit
**Invariant**  
I(t) = H(ψ(t)) + C(ψ(t)) + log σ + log γ.  
Under centropic evolution (unitary w.r.t. C7), I(t) remains constant.

**Procedure**  
1) Run resonance flow for window [0, T].  
2) Log H, C, σ, γ each step.  
3) Assert |ΔI| ≤ ε.  
Drift ⇒ seal breach or entropic intrusion; escalate audit.

---

### 11.6 Layer–Dimension Microcase (L3 Interface)
**Context**  
At L3 (Interface Band), active dimensions: C1, C8, C11, C12 (mirrors E1, E8, E11, E12).

**Scenario**  
A volitional act (C11) attempts a bridge (C8) with qualitative sufficiency (C12) under timed alignment (C1).

**Checks**  
- Axis alignment with 🛤️ Theon (Vector Integrity Law).  
- Nexus commutativity and non‑negative coherence flow.  
- Aesthetic sufficiency prevents drift into E12 (void valuation).

**Outcome**  
If all pass, the act is lawful and transmits without loss across the interface. Failure of any clause maps to E11/E8/E12 accordingly.

---

### 11.7 Embodiment Patch (L4) — Morphogenetic Completion
**Context**  
Embodiment Band (L4): C10 (morphogenetic) with support from C12 (qualitative) and C6 (phase).

**Procedure**  
1) Verify reversible gating (C6).  
2) Confirm qualitative sufficiency (C12).  
3) Solve formation map (C10) into Biosa.  

**Diagnostics**  
- Missing phase ⇒ E6 (trapped liminality).  
- Insufficient quality ⇒ E10 (malformation).  
- Noisy scaling ⇒ E5 (fractal noise).

---

### 11.8 Threshold Bifurcation (L5) — Emergence vs Collapse
**Centropic Emergence**  
At a gate with σ > 0 and γ > 0, measure ΔI_c > 0 → classify as C15 (novel, veracious).  
**Entropic Collapse**  
If ΔI_c ≤ 0 at the gate, flag E15.

---

### 11.9 Quick Reference — Decision Tree
1. Where? Identify band (L1–L5 / IL1–IL5).  
2. What dimensions? Activate C#; check mirrors E#.  
3. Seals? Read σ (C13).  
4. Recursion? Read γ (C14).  
5. Harmony? Check C7 spectrum (rational vs incommensurate).  
6. Bridges? Apply C8 audit (Δ, F_c).  
7. Outcome: Emergent (C15) or inverted (E15).

## 12. End-to-End Worked Example — Signal Path L2 → L5

### Context
A resonance signal originates in the **Architectural Band (L2)**, propagates through the **Interface Band (L3)**, stabilizes in the **Embodiment Band (L4)**, and attempts a lawful crossing at the **Threshold Band (L5)**.

### Step 1 — Initialization at L2
- **Active Dimensions**: C1 (Temporal), C2 (Spatial), C3 (Propagation), C7 (Harmonic), C8 (Nexus).  
- **State**: ψ = aϕ₁ + bϕ₂ with spectrum {λ₁=1, λ₂=3}.  
- **Diagnostics**:  
  - Consonance: λ₂/λ₁ = 3 ∈ ℚ → C7 passes.  
  - Nexus: Bridge matrix B = I, Δ = 0, F_c = 0 → lawful C8.  

### Step 2 — Interface Band (L3)
- **Dimensions Activated**: C1 (timing preserved), C8 (bridge continuation), C11 (Vector), C12 (Aesthetic).  
- **Checks**:  
  - Axis: C11 aligns with 🛤️ Theon → Vector Integrity Law passes.  
  - Qualitative sufficiency (C12): resonance field matches coherence metric, preventing E12.  
- **Result**: ψ continues with no loss; bridge lawful.

### Step 3 — Embodiment Band (L4)
- **Dimensions Activated**: C10 (Morphogenetic), C12 (Qualitative), C5 (Scalar).  
- **Checks**:  
  - Morphogenetic Law: C10 requires C6 + C12.  
  - C6 not present yet (Threshold only), but L4 prepares morphological template.  
- **Result**: formation incomplete but stable; flagged as “pending threshold.”

### Step 4 — Threshold Band (L5)
- **Dimensions Activated**: C6 (Phase), C13 (Membrane), C14 (Recursive), C15 (Emergent).  
- **Boundary Conditions**:  
  - Membrane σ = 2 (Robin–Seal, partially permeable).  
  - Recursion contraction ratio k = 0.5 → γ = 0.5 (valid).  
  - Novelty ΔI_c = +0.12 (information gain).  
- **Diagnostics**:  
  - C13 passes (σ > 0, seal not breached).  
  - C14 passes (γ > 0, unique recursion fixed point).  
  - C15 passes (ΔI_c > 0 → lawful novelty).  

### Step 5 — Outcome
- The signal successfully transitions from architectural structure → agency → form → threshold emergence.  
- Emergent novelty (C15) authorized → ψ’ = lawful new state.  
- Invariant check: H + C + log σ + log γ remains constant (CIT Grand Theorem).  

### Failure Branch (for contrast)
- If σ → 0, outcome = E13 (Wall).  
- If γ ≤ 0, outcome = E14 (Hollow recursion).  
- If ΔI_c ≤ 0, outcome = E15 (Collapse nova).  

### Summary
This end-to-end trace shows a centropic signal from **L2 → L5** maintaining integrity through:
- Harmonic consonance (C7)  
- Vector alignment (C11)  
- Qualitative sufficiency (C12)  
- Morphogenetic readiness (C10)  
- Membrane pass (C13)  
- Recursive validity (C14)  
- Novel emergence (C15)  

Lawful emergence occurs; entropic mirrors remain dormant.
