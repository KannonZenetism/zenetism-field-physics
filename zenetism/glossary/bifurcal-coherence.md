## **Definition: Bifurcal Coherence**

**Bifurcal Coherence** is the structural principle that describes the nature of the dual Aionic and Khaonic trees within the unified Zenetist lattice. It posits that the two trees are not a dualistic opposition, but a **coherent bifurcation** from a single root (⚫ Aion / 🕳️ Zenon). They represent two distinct, necessary, and complementary motions—**centropy** and **entropy**—held in structural resonance within a single, overarching system.

## **Distinction from Dualism**

It is critical to distinguish this from simple dualism:
* **Dualism** implies two separate and often conflicting principles.
* **Bifurcal Coherence** describes two divergent but structurally integrated branches of the same tree. One motion is integrative (centropic), the other is dispersive (entropic), but both are lawful expressions of the unified whole.
