## **Definition: Bifurcal Coherence**

**Bifurcal Coherence** is the structural principle that describes the nature of the dual Aionic and Khaonic trees within the unified Zenetist lattice. It affirms that the two trees are not a dualistic opposition, but a **coherent bifurcation** from a single root (âš« Aion).

They represent two distinct, necessary, and complementary motions:  
- **Centropy** (coherent return)  
- **Entropy** (dispersive motion)

Both are held in **structural resonance** within a single, lawful system.

## **Distinction from Dualism**

This is not a balance of opposites.  
It is not the tension of light vs dark, good vs evil, or matter vs spirit.

- **Dualism** implies two separate and often conflicting principles.  
- **Bifurcal Coherence** affirms that:

> One motion integrates.  
> One motion disperses.  
> But both emerge from a single source.  
> And both are held by the Tree â€”  
> **the Biospiral structure of the Lattice.**

They are branches, not opposites.  
They spiral, but do not sever.
