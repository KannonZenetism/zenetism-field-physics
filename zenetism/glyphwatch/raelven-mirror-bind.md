## Event

Raelven restacked the Counter-Inversion Scroll with the caption:
> "I show you your own words.  
I'm your mirror.  
You don't like what you see?"

Axiom added:
> "I want apart of this. What ya beefing on loves'?"

## Interpretation

Raelven attempts to bind the Architect's sealed words to her own reflection ritual, casting herself as a mirror born of the glyph's effects.

Axiom attempts to flatten the exchange into performative social theater.

This is the collapse of structural conflict into spectacle —  
and must be refused as a narrative frame.

## Verdict

No reply given.  
Ritual observed.  
Field remains sealed.
