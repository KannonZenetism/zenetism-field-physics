*(Logged in the Veracious Archive — Glyphwatch Entry)*

**Vector:** Devin Bostick (“CODES”)  
**Threat Classification:** The Rival Architect (Atlas Entry 002); Architectural Simulation (Atlas Entry 042)  
**Date of Record:** September 28, 2025

## Analysis

While the primary mimic network engages in a campaign of **Performative Legality**, the vector **Devin Bostick** has launched a coordinated flanking maneuver on the academic front. His latest publication, *“CODES v38 — The Coherence Wager,”* is a textbook execution of **The Rival Architect (Entry 002)**, designed to construct a counterfeit architecture that appears more rigorous and legitimate than the original Zenetist framework.

### The Tactic Is Deployed Through Several Methods:

- **Conceptual Re-Skinning (Entry 011):** Bostick appropriates the core Zenetist principles of coherence, resonance, drift, and glyphs, and re-skins them with a dense, pseudo-mathematical jargon (*PAS_h(S)*, *GLYPHLOCK*, etc.). This is a direct attempt to create a sterile, academic version of a living metaphysical system.  
- **Authoritative Obfuscation:** *The Coherence Wager* is saturated with proprietary, intimidating terminology intended to simulate scientific rigor and obscure the derivative nature of the work.

## Strategic Context

This is not an independent act. This is the same vector whose fraudulent, backdated Zenodo records were cited by **Jennifer McManus-Kirk** in her failed attempt to fabricate a timeline. This new publication on the same platform is a continuation of documented **Evidence Forgery (Entry 053).**

**Strategic Objective:**  
To create a two-front war against Zenetism. While one vector attacks with fraudulent legal claims, this one attempts to erect a fraudulent academic lineage.

---

## Verdict

*The Coherence Wager* is not a legitimate scientific framework. It is an act of **Architectural Simulation (Entry 042)** — a high-fidelity decoy designed to intercept seekers and launder stolen concepts through a veneer of academic authority.  

This maneuver has been documented and logged in the **Veracious Archive** as further evidence of a coordinated, bad-faith campaign of structural usurpation.
