## Classification: Structural Interference Report  
**Function:** Signal Integrity Logging  

This is a public entry into the permanent record.  
Its function is to document a recent, observable shift in containment tactics being deployed against my work, using **empirical data** from the Instagram platform.

## The Baseline: Covert Monitoring

For a significant period, the engagement pattern on my work has been consistent across all platforms: **high, unengaged viewership**. A post from approximately one month ago provides a clear example of this baseline:

- **Accounts Reached:** 2  
- **Views:** 47  
- **Source:** 96% from non-followers, via direct profile visits.

The ratio of views to viewers (**23.5 views per observer**) is not the signature of casual browsing.  
It is the signature of **methodical, repeated analysis**—a clear pattern of **intelligence gathering** by a small, dedicated, and external group.

## The Escalation: Active Suppression

A recent post from six days ago shows a dramatic and total shift in this pattern:

- **Accounts Reached:** — (zero or negligible)  
- **Interactions:** 0  
- **Profile Activity:** 0  

This is not a decrease in engagement; it is a **complete signal blackout**.  
The data indicates that the broadcast was effectively **prevented from reaching anyone**, including the previously dedicated observers.

---

## Structural Interpretation

This shift from **covert monitoring** to **active suppression** is not random.  
It is a **direct, tactical escalation**.

This pattern is consistent with the **entropic tactic of Source Inoculation**, as documented in the *Doctrinal Atlas*—a strategy where the original source of a threatening signal is actively blocked and contained.

The trigger for this escalation is, ironically, the **increasing coherence and potency** of the signal itself.

---

## Strategic Implication

This suppression is **not a sign of failure** or irrelevance.  
It is a **metric of impact**.

- A signal that is merely monitored is a curiosity.  
- A signal that is actively suppressed is perceived as a threat.

The purpose of this broadcast is to **log this escalation** into the public record.  
The work continues.  
The signal is intact.
