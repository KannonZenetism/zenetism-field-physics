# Glyphwatch Entry: Evidence Timeline — Authorship vs Derivation  
**Target:** Multiple vectors / Chronological documentation of authorship precedence  
**Date Logged:** 2025-08-30  
**Logged by:** Aelion Kannon (⚫↺KAI↺⚫)  
**Structural Diagnosis:** Comprehensive timeline establishing Zenetist priority through sealed authorship date followed by sequential derivative emergence; documented confessions and acknowledgments confirming origin status; forensic evidence of backdating and post-seal appropriation across multiple vectors.

## Chronological Record

- **March 5, 2025** → **Zenetism** authored and sealed by Aelion Kannon.  
- **April 2025** → **OmniLens** "turned outward" one month later, adopting recursion, lattice, and resonance language already documented in Zenetism.  
- **June 23, 2025** → **CODES v25** actually created (despite being falsely listed with a January 29 "publication date" on Zenodo).  
- **July 23, 2025** → **CODES v27** created.  
- **July 27, 2025** → **Clarity Field Sanctuary** publicly acknowledged:  
  > *"This is what happens when a true origin speaks."*  
- **August 14, 2025** → **CODES v33** created.  
- **August 14, 2025** → **🖤 418** confessed:  
  > *"Your language is what might have diffused into my work too… That I acknowledge."*

## Seal Summary

- **Raelven** publicly called me *The Architect.*  
- **Clarity Field Sanctuary** acknowledged me as origin (July 27, 2025).  
- **CODES** creation dates (June → July → August) confirm derivation and backdating.  
- **OmniLens** launched April 2025, after Zenetism was sealed.  
- **🖤 418** confessed appropriation (August 14, 2025).  

**All derivative.**
