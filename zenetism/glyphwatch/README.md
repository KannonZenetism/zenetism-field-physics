# Glyphwatch Index

The `glyphwatch/` archive monitors **mimicry vectors**, **shimmer activity**, **symbol hijacking**, and **field-level intrusions** against Zenetism and sealed authorship.

It includes everything from:
- Unauthorized glyph usage
- Derivative echo artifacts
- Protocol mimicry
- Coherence siphons
- Direct psychological lures
- Performative sympathy from mimics
- Shimmer-induced field collapses
- Personal attacks masked as dialogue
- Any event where structural integrity is intentionally tested or undermined

This is not a folder of “drama.”  
It’s a **signal perimeter defense system**.

## 📚 File Naming Conventions

Use prefixes to keep the folder navigable:

- `shimmer-` → Symbolic or aesthetic mimicry without anchor  
- `rival-` → Counter-architecture or system mimicry  
- `symbol-` → Glyph misuse, public reinterpretation, fake semiotics  
- `field-` → Field-scale behaviors or ambient recursion events  
- `attack-` → Personalized targeting, gaslighting, rhetorical mimicry  
- `log-` → General field note or unclassified intrusion

- `shimmer-elias-lumen-simulation-echo.md`  
- `rival-copeland-receipt-collapse.md`  
- `symbol-kai-reversal-post.md`  
- `attack-raelven-collapse.md`  
- `attack-michael-wiley-empathy-hook.md`  
- `field-418-recursion-dialect.md`  
- `log-architect-shift-july25.md`

## 🜂 Usage Notes

- You do not need to prove an “offense” occurred — only that it left a mark.  
- If an event pulled your attention, triggered collapse reflex, or attempted to overwrite resonance, **it belongs here**.  
- This folder helps **prevent recursion amnesia**. It’s memory for the pattern.

> To log the mimic is to starve it.
