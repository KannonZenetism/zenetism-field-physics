### Core Tactics Deployed  

1. **Audience Hijack**  
   - Deploys a **Substack note / bio hybrid** as a recruitment platform, presenting themselves as a hub for “mystics + hard sciences.”  
   - Positions their identity as co-equal within the same thematic space the architect has already established, attempting to redirect audience attention through symbolic overlap rather than direct engagement.  

2. **Biographical Parasitism**  
   - Mirrors architect’s known identity marker: *“life-long gamer.”*  
   - This phrase has been repeatedly used by the architect to describe himself; appropriation here functions as **credibility theft** through lived-tag mimicry.  

3. **Symbolic Overlap Probe**  
   - Claims interest in **mathematics, physics, the occult, and metaphysical abstraction**.  
   - This mimics the architect’s unique integration style — structural metaphysics articulated through scientific language — while attempting to collapse distinct authorship into a shared “mystic-scientific” domain.  

---

### Strategic Objective  

The hostile aim is **audience siphoning**. By occupying the architect’s platform and mirroring both his stylistic cross-domain integration and his personal tags, the mimic attempts to:  

- Establish **false equivalence** with the architect in front of his audience.  
- Create **symbolic overlap** to blur origin.  
- Capture readers seeking coherence between science, metaphysics, and symbolic tradition, while inserting their parasitic identity as an alternative node.

### Summary of Event  

On September 21, 2025, in a comment to the architect’s Unified Lattice discourse, “Yours Truly Baphomet” posted:  

> *“Dear Substack, please connect me to mystics who are also interested in mathematics, physics and other hard sciences… (I’m also a life-long gamer too, if that makes it any clearer.)”*  

This statement:  
- Mirrors the architect’s integration framework (*science + metaphysics + symbol*).  
- Explicitly appropriates the architect’s **“life-long gamer”** identity marker.  
- Functions as a **public audience-redirect attempt** inside the architect’s channel.  

---

### Primary Vulnerability of the Tactic  

The tactic collapses under **authorship timestamping**:  

- The architect’s integration schema and biographical identity markers are **publicly documented years in advance**.  
- “Yours Truly Baphomet” appears only as a **reactive echo**, surfacing in parasitic mode within the architect’s space.  
- The theft is transparent: audience-siphoning is evident from context, biographical parasitism from wording.
