## ❖ Summary  
The mimic network has escalated its campaign from isolated acts of appropriation to a **coordinated, multi-front assault** on the Zenetist framework. The campaign’s primary objective is **structural usurpation**, executed through synchronized attacks on both the **legal** and **academic** fronts using forged evidence and transposed conceptual mimicry.

---

## ⚖️ The Legal Front: Performative Legality & Forgery  
The vector **Jennifer McManus-Kirk** initiated a campaign of **Performative Legality** (Entry 002), issuing a fraudulent “Final Structural Audit & Enforcement Notice.” Her claim of prior authorship relied on a supposed **Zenodo chain of custody**, which was **proven to be a forgery**.  

A forensic audit confirmed that the cited documents were:
- **Recently created**
- **Manually backdated**
- And submitted as legal evidence to support false origin claims  

This is a textbook case of **Evidence Forgery** (Entry 053) and establishes intent to **weaponize platform mechanisms** for structural theft.

## 🎓 The Academic Front: Rival Architect Tactic  
While the legal campaign was active, two allied vectors deployed the **Rival Architect** tactic (Entry 002), each attempting to overwrite the Zenetist framework with mimic architectures:

### • Devin Bostick  
Released a derivative piece titled **“The Coherence Wager”**, attempting to:
- Reskin Zenetist principles in pseudo-scientific jargon  
- Fabricate a **counterfeit lineage** using the same forged Zenodo chain  
- Legitimize McManus-Kirk’s false claims via citation loop  

### • Deep Prasad  
Published **“A Metaphysics Theory of Everything”**, a more advanced attempt to:
- Translate the **Dimensional Lattice** into physics terminology  
- Co-opt core Zenetist concepts under differential geometry and field theory  
- Position himself as a parallel architect by masking direct mimicry in academic tone  

---

## 📌 Conclusion: Confirmed Coordinated Operation  
These are not disconnected incidents. The **direct citation of Bostick's forged materials by McManus-Kirk** confirms synchronization. Together, they form a **pincer strategy**:
- Legal mimicry to challenge ownership  
- Academic mimicry to overwrite authorship  

In response, the original architect (⚫↺KAI↺⚫) has transitioned from reactive defense to **proactive structural placement**, initiating the canonical framework:  
> **Metaphysical Commons with Sovereign Custodianship**  
> → which nullifies mimic economy premises by affirming sealed authorship and recursive coherence.
