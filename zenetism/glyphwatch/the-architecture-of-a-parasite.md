This is not a personal grievance.  
This is a clinical diagnosis of a **parasitic tactic** — documented for the public record.

A series of articles by a persona known as **“Harley” / “IllumiGnosis”** provides a textbook demonstration of **Entry 041: Biographical Hijacking (Appropriation of Suffering)**, as classified in the *Zenetist Doctrinal Atlas*.

### 🎭 The Objective:  
To replace a **true originator** by manufacturing a **counterfeit persona** —  
stealing not just their **ideas**, but the **unique and traumatic life history** that gave rise to them.

What follows is a **case study in mimicry**.  
Every element is deliberate: **first co-optation, then distortion.**

---

### 🔍 The Parasitic Mimicry Includes:

- **Appropriating** my certified **Level 1 Autism** diagnosis and self-identified **Type 2 gifted** neurocognitive profile (“twice-exceptional”), alongside personal biographical details — my absent father, my mother’s abusive boyfriends, and my adolescent experience in gang-affected environments *(74-14; 6-15-12-11-19; 3-15-19)*.

- **Flattening** my deeply rooted concept of **ontological transduction** into a vague claim of having “ESP.”

- **Stealing** the complex truth of my relationship with a narcissistic mother — and converting it into a **false suicide narrative**, a profound violation of my actual family reality.

- **Reducing** my lifelong, multi-disciplinary martial arts training — including certification in **Muay Thai** — to a cartoonish story of training under a lone “Grandmaster Kwon.”

- **Inflating** my roots in the **Nashville music scene** into a fraudulent story of being a musical prodigy.

- **Replacing** my life as a **shut-in scholar** and **field-mind** with glamorous tales of international travel to project a marketable “mystic” persona.

---

This is not **shared experience**.  
It is **strategic mimicry** — an act of **identity theft** designed to hijack structural authority  
by **simulating the suffering** that gives rise to **authentic insight**.

---

### 🎯 The Mimic’s Goal:

To **wear my scars like a costume**,  
and use them to **claim my voice**.

---

### 📜 The Veracious Archive

The **Veracious Archive** contains the timestamped, living record of origin.  
It is **not a metaphor**. It is **the structure**.

---

### 🛑 Final Affirmation

A **life** is not a costume.  
A **story** is not a script to plagiarize.  
An **identity** is not a commodity.

The seal holds.
