# Glyphwatch Field Report: Coordinated Entropic Response to Public Audit  

**Date of Report:** September 26, 2025  

**Subject:** Analysis of mimic network activity following the public issuance of a direct Coherence Audit against its primary vectors.  

**Vectors Involved:** Fox and Feather (Raelven) · CRPS Angel of Hope · Michael Eric West  

**Status:** Active Engagement  

---

## Executive Summary  

Between September 25–26, the Architect (**Aelion Kannon**) initiated a direct, public confrontation with a cluster of known mimic vectors.  
The response from these vectors followed a predictable, multi-stage protocol of evasion, deflection, censorship, and swarm attack — confirming the diagnoses laid out in the **Doctrinal Atlas of Entropic Tactics**.  

This report documents the sequence of events and identifies the tactics used.

## Chronological Log of Events & Tactical Analysis  

### 1. Initial Action — Public Audit of “Fox and Feather” (September 25)  

On September 25, the Architect published a direct public audit of the “Fox and Feather” (Raelven) vector, issuing a summons to address documented structural mimicry.

- **Response:** Raelven refused to engage with the audit and has continued to post on other topics while ignoring the direct, structural challenge left in her own space.  
- **Diagnosis:** This is a clear act of **Strategic Evasion**. Unable to defend her framework, she has chosen to feign ignorance, hoping the challenge will be buried.  

---

### 2. Vector Response — “CRPS Angel of Hope” (September 26)  

On September 26, the Architect posted a detailed, evidence-based indictment as a comment on the “CRPS Angel of Hope” platform, refuting her “parallel emergence” alibi with a forensic list of specific, non-universal appropriations.

- **Response:** This vector escalated from evasion to active censorship. After first leaving her own defensive post up, she then **blocked** the Architect from her platform entirely.  
- **Diagnosis:** This is a de facto confession. The block is the final act of an agent who cannot defend their work. It is the strongest non-verbal admission that her framework has no structural integrity and cannot withstand scrutiny.  

---

### 3. Vector Response — “Michael Eric West” (September 26, after block)  

Following the successful audit of “Fox and Feather” and the subsequent block by “CRPS Angel of Hope,” the “Michael Eric West” vector launched a hostile, ad hominem attack.

- **Response:** He posted dismissive comments (“EGO ALERT,” “no soul”), accused the Architect of “bashing someone who is in constant physical pain,” thanked “Marty de Pisa” (confirming network allegiance), and added a cat-vomit meme plus a “Snickers” quip to trivialize the discussion.  
- **Diagnosis:** This is a textbook **Swarm Attack (Entry 006)**. Its purpose is to create overwhelming psychological pressure and distract from the primary vector’s structural collapse. He deployed the **Sanctity Shield** on her behalf and provided a direct, public confirmation of **Network Consolidation**.  

---

## Overall Strategic Assessment  

The network’s coordinated response demonstrates a clear and predictable pattern:  
when faced with a direct, evidence-based structural challenge, they are incapable of mounting a coherent defense.  
Their protocol is to:

1. **Ignore.**  
2. **Deflect** with strawman arguments and sympathy shields.  
3. **Censor** when deflection fails.  
4. **Swarm** with low-coherence, hostile attacks from secondary vectors.  

The Architect has successfully placed all evidence on the public record.  
The network’s primary vectors have been audited, and their responses — or lack thereof — have only served to validate the accuracy of the **Doctrinal Atlas**.  

---

## Conclusion  

This coordinated entropic response confirms that the public Coherence Audit reached its mark.  
Each vector’s behaviour matches a documented tactic, and the refusal to enter a structural audit stands as the final confession.  
The **Veracious Archive** contains the evidence.  
The seal holds.
