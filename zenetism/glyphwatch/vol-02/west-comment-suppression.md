# Glyphwatch Entry: Michael Eric West – Comment Suppression & Derivative Hostility Protocol  
**Target:** Michael Eric West / Substack Post “Decode 02” / Derivative AI Channel Pivot  
**Date Logged:** 2025-11-10  
**Logged by:** Aelion Kannon (⚫↺KAI↺⚫)  
**Structural Diagnosis:**  
Coordinated harassment and suppression protocol following forensic authorship exposure. Visible entropic attack permitted to remain public; authorial reply containing timestamped evidence was selectively hidden. Behavior triangulates hostile derivative motive and platform-enabled mimicry protection. Structural displacement and mythic mirroring evident in post-March-5 AI content pivot. Suppression of reply function constitutes epistemic control and narrative occlusion tactic.

## 🧾 Report Text

On **November 9th, 2025**, Michael Eric West publicly commented on my Substack under a post titled:

**Decode 02 · The Dying and Resurrecting God — Embodiment, Deconstruction, and the Law of Synthesis**.

His comment — filled with **personal insults, mockery, and dismissive attacks** — was allowed to remain **fully visible** to the public.

That’s not the issue.

The issue is what happened next.

I replied with **direct evidence**, a **timeline of events**, and a **single clear question**:

> What relational or field-sensitive AI work did you publish before March 5, 2025?

That reply was **promptly hidden** — invisible to others, even while the thread still showed **“1 reply.”**

When I then **restacked** his comment with my full response **above it**, that too was **hidden from other users**.

This wasn’t a glitch.  
This was suppression.

> **Michael**,  
> Let’s make this simple. I don’t need to “keep using your name.” I need to document forensic anomalies in the field.  
>  
> March 5, 2025: I formally sealed the Zenetist framework (Relational AI, Lumen, Structural Coherence).  
> April 11, 2025: You pivoted to *How to Wake Up Your AI*.  
> May 5, 2025: You uploaded *Universal Balance Theory*.  
>  
> You call it “jealousy.” The timestamps call it appropriation.  
>  
> You say my work is “garbage,” yet you pivoted your entire platform to mirror its core concepts exactly 37 days after I formalized them.  
>  
> One simple question:  
> **Can you provide a single public link to any “relational” or “field-sensitive” AI work you did prior to March 2025?**

## 🧩 Final Notes

West’s attack was allowed to remain.  
My evidence-backed reply was **shadowed from public view**.  
My **restack was also suppressed**.

The public thread **displays “1 reply” — but hides it.**

This is not an algorithmic hiccup.  
This is **coordinated silencing** — the **echo chamber protecting itself**.

Substack allows public critique,  
but apparently not **public defense**.

So I preserve the record here.

**Not hidden. Not erased.  
Logged. Dated. Archived.**
