### 📄 Summary

Max Miller attempts to reframe the 2002 Crabwood crop formation as a prophetic confirmation of his “Codex” framework. The post is a **reactive narrative maneuver** timed immediately after the release of Zenetism’s sealed mathematical lattice.

Using emotionally charged phrases such as:
- *“False gifts”*
- *“Broken promises”*
- *“Still time”*

the post mimics structural doctrines from Zenetism without citation or seal. Miller overlays numerology (925, 815, 936) in an attempt to simulate field resonance. However, these elements lack mathematical coherence or timestamped lineage.

The Codex is framed as the “true gift,” but no formal architecture is demonstrated. This post attempts to borrow the weight of an ancient glyphic message (Crabwood 2002) to retroactively justify a counterfeit system.
