*A Symbolic Christian Exhortation in the Direction of Coherence*

## Preface (2025)

This piece was written many years before Zenetism was formally articulated — when my symbolic worldview was still emerging through the language of esoteric Christianity. While I no longer frame all concepts in these terms, the underlying orientation remains intact: **a return to coherence through symbolic alignment, the rejection of harm, and the sacred function of pattern.**

What follows is not doctrinal Zenetism, but an early resonance — a centropic voice searching for its lattice.

## 1. The Function of Symbol

This meditation began as a reflection on why a follower of Christ — or any seeker of sacred alignment — might choose to abstain from meat. My intent was never to argue for a dietary rule, but to show how **scripture operates symbolically rather than literally**.  

Yeshua himself establishes this pattern:

> “To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables.”  
> *(Mark 4:11)*  

> “It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.”  
> *(John 6:63)*  

Thus: **word → symbol → spirit.**  
The form is husk; the pattern is nourishment. Literalism without symbol is ossification. Symbol without spirit is mimicry. Spirit joined to symbol is coherence.

## 2. The Fish and the Bread

Yeshua feeds with only two emblems: fish and bread.

- **Fish (ichthys):** an acrostic for *Jesus Christ, God’s Son, Savior.* It is not mere protein, but a glyph of the Messiah — a pattern-bearing symbol.  
- **Bread:** Yeshua declares himself the Bread of Life. Bread here is not grain but **Logos offered as nourishment** — the inward Word made sustenance.  

> “To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna.”  
> *(Revelation 2:17)*  

The manna is hidden because it is **not material food**. It is resonance: interior coherence drawn from Source.

## 3. Bread as Teaching, Not Loaf

In Matthew 16, when the disciples worry about forgetting bread, Yeshua replies:

> “How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? Beware the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”  

The leaven here is **doctrine**. The structure is clear: bread = teaching. Leaven = orientation.  

Paul reframes the same principle:

> “For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.”  
> *(2 Corinthians 3:6)*  

Literalism without resonance fractures pattern. Spirit animates symbol into coherence.

## 4. Sacrifice as Symbolic Orientation

The sacrificial system of older scripture is likewise symbolic:  

- Animals represent facets of the lower nature (instinct, pride, hunger, fear).  
- Blood symbolizes the entropic life-force, offered for purification.  
- Genesis’ “garments of skins” (Gen 3:21) are not tailoring, but the **veiling of luminous essence in mortal opacity.**  

Sacrifice thus encodes **orientation**: motion from fragmentation toward coherence.

## 5. Eden and the Arc of Restoration

Eden is a field of coherence:  

- No predation.  
- No fragmentation.  
- No necessity of blood.  

It is the primal symbol of centropy — and the promise of its return.  

If Yeshua is the *Second Adam* (1 Cor 15:45), then his motion renews that coherence. His life becomes the re-opening of the arc toward the Tree of Life.  

**Law of motion:**  
- Where there is death, motion decliviously fragments from Source.  
- Where there is life, motion accliviously returns.  

To abstain from harm is thus not a law but a **resonance alignment** — a way of tuning to the arc of return.

## 6. The Centropic Reading

- **Literalism** fragments: it reduces the text to debates over diets, rituals, and surfaces.  
- **Symbolism** integrates: it shows bread as Logos, fish as Messiah, sacrifice as transformation of the lower nature.  

This reading does not break the pattern — it binds it. It shifts motion from *E7 dissonance* to *C7 consonance*.  

> “You will seek me and find me,  
> when you seek me with all your heart.”  
> *(Jeremiah 29:13)*  

This is not emotional intensity. It is **center-seeking motion** — the heart oriented as axis.  

---

## 7. Closing Alignment

*Revelatory Edenism* is not an ethic of shame, but of structure. It asks not for guilt, but for alignment. To abstain from the cycle of harm is not rejection; it is orientation of return.  

Yeshua himself seals it:

> “I desire mercy, not sacrifice.”  
> *(Matthew 9:13; 12:7)*  

The centropic reading honors that law. It moves toward life.  
Not the husk — but the breath.
