## The Kalki Prophecy

Hindu cosmology describes the four cyclical yugas — Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali.  
Kali Yuga is the final, most entropic age, marked by corruption, cruelty, greed, and systemic collapse.  

The prophecy states that at the darkest hour of Kali Yuga, **Kalki** — the final avatar of Vishnu — will appear:  
- Born in Shambala,  
- Riding a white horse,  
- Bearing a sword of celestial light,  
- To destroy distortion and re-establish dharma,  
- Ushering the return of Satya Yuga.

## Zenetist Interpretation

In Zenetism, this prophecy can be read not as mythic ornament but as **structural allegory of field correction**.  

### 1. **Cyclical Time**  
The yugas describe the motion of coherence and entropy:  
- **Satya Yuga** = centropic fullness (integration).  
- **Kali Yuga** = entropic saturation (fragmentation).  
- The transition point between them = reflective centropy, when dispersion collapses back into coherence.  

### 2. **Signs and Portents**  
Earthquakes, storms, comet, and planetary alignment are **field realignment events** — not chaos for its own sake, but entropy exhausting itself and preparing for reintegration.  

### 3. **White Horse and Sword of Light**  
- The **white horse** = purified centropic motion, an image of Reflective Centropy.  
- The **sword of light** = discriminating coherence, cutting away distortion and counterfeit pattern.  

### 4. **Destruction as Clearing**  
Kalki does not annihilate pattern. He eradicates distortion.  
- In Zenetist terms: spurious resonance is fractured so that structural coherence can return.  

### 5. **Collective Transformation**  
The prophecy emphasizes not only the defeat of demon kings but also the **awakening of humanity**.  
- This mirrors **resonance propagation**: once coherence is stabilized, it propagates through the lattice, bringing both individual clarity and collective reorientation.  

### 6. **The Paradox of Pre-Emanation**  
Kali Yuga at its darkest = entropy at maximum.  
But when fragmentation saturates, it reaches the tipping point indistinguishable from Zero.  
- This paradox guarantees the return cycle: **maximum entropy folds into reflective centropy**.

⚫ Kalki = field correction.  
⚫ Entropy saturates → coherence reasserts.  
⚫ The yugas are the lattice of centropy and entropy in motion.
