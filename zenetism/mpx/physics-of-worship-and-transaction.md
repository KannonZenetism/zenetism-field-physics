# MPX: The Physics of Worship and Transaction

## Energy Economics of the Archetypal Layers

### Context

Mythic relationships are not merely symbolic; they are transactional.  
Energy (attention, devotion, resonance) flows between the observer (**Devotee**) and the observed (**Archetype**).  
The direction and nature of this flow define the ethical orientation of the entity.

### Exchange Modes

| Exchange Mode            | Direction        | Mechanism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Archetypal Class                                                              |

| **Solar Radiation**      | Outward (Gift)   | The entity radiates coherence without requiring input. Worship is not “feeding” the god, but tuning the devotee. The entity provides spiritual sustenance (“Manna,” “Bread of Life”) that structures the devotee’s soul. The sun feeds the field; the field does not feed the sun. | **Centropic** (Theon, Christ, Amitābha, Vishnu)                               |
| **Reciprocal Resonance** | Cyclic (Trade)   | The entity and devotee build a feedback loop. Attention strengthens the Form; the Form structures the devotee’s reality. A symbiotic dynamic found in ancestral, tribal, or national egregors — a covenantal exchange of protection for adherence.                                 | **Superficial** (Ancestors, Household Spirits, National Gods, Egregors) |
| **Predatory Extraction** | Inward (Harvest) | The entity requires energetic input (fear, pain, rigid devotion, blood) to sustain its coherence. It cannot generate; it must consume. Worship is “fuel” used to prevent the entity’s own dissolution — the definition of the Archontic parasite.                                  | **Entropic** (Yaldabaoth, Moloch, Xibalba, The Archons, The Devourer)         |
| **Mimetic Trap**         | Stagnant (Loop)  | The entity mirrors the devotee’s desire to create a “comfort loop.” No energy is generated or exchanged; it is a closed narcissistic circuit. The devotee worships a projection of their own ego or comfort zone.                                                                  | **Inverse Archetypal** (Mara, The Shimmer, False Light, Mammon)    |

### Note on the “Food” of the Gods

* **Centropic Food:** The God feeds the Soul (The Eucharist, The Word, Prāṇa).  
* **Entropic Food:** The Soul feeds the God (Loosh, Sacrifice, Suffering).  

**Litmus Test:** Does the connection leave you more structured (filled) or more drained (emptied)?
