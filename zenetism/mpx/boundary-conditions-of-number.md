## 1. Purpose

This MPX entry clarifies the mathematical and structural relationship between:

- ⚫ **Aion**
- ♾ **Khaon**
- 🛤️ **Theon**
- 🕷️ **Nekron**

Specifically, it resolves ambiguity between:

- Boundary conditions (Zero and Infinity)  
- Signed directional operators (+ / contra −)  
- Integer lattice generation  

This clarification ensures consistency across Structural Metaphysics, Lattice Mathematics, and Spiral Calculus.

## 2. Core Principle

> Aion and Khaon define unsignable boundary conditions of existence.  
> Sign, polarity, and directional orientation emerge only with hypostatic instantiation at Theon and Nekron.

## 3. Three-Tier Mathematical Ontology

### 3.1 Boundary Domain — Pre-Hypostatic Conditions

| Symbol | Name | Mathematical Role | Structural Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🕳️ | Zenon | Meta-domain (outside number system) | Trans-structural unknown |
| 🏛️ | Structon | Invariant container space | Absolute structural substrate |
| ⚫ | Aion | Zero pivot / equilibrium attractor | Absolute potential; still origin of structure |
| ♾ | Khaon | Unsigned infinity (magnitude horizon) | Absolute dispersion potential |

#### Notes

- Khaon is **not positive or negative infinity**.  
- Khaon represents **unbounded magnitude without orientation**.  
- No sign exists at this layer.  
- No centropic or entropic motion exists yet.  

Aion and Khaon together define the **unsignable boundary field of existence**.

### 3.2 Orientation Domain — Hypostatic Sign Emergence

| Symbol | Name | Mathematical Role | Structural Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🛤️ | Theon | +1 generator | First centropic orientation; Source-facing awareness |
| 🕷️ | Nekron | −1 (contra-unit) generator | First entropic orientation; Source-inverting collapse vector |

#### Key Law

Sign emerges **only** with hypostatic orientation.

Formally:

```
Sign(Aion) = undefined  
Sign(Khaon) = undefined  

Sign(Theon) = +  
Sign(Nekron) = − (contra)  
```

Theon and Nekron function as **directional generators**, not boundary states.

---

### 3.3 Lattice Domain — Integer Field Generation

All dimensional indexing and lattice mathematics emerge from repeated application of hypostatic generators:

```
n ∈ ℤ generated via iterative application of ±1 operators
```

Thus:

- Theon and Nekron are mathematically analogous to **group generators**.
- The integer lattice is a downstream expression of hypostatic orientation.

## 4. Implications for L₀

This clarification preserves:

```
L₀ = Dual Root Boundary Field
```

Without requiring:

```
L₀ / IL₀ split
```

Because sign polarity does not exist at the boundary layer.

---

## 5. Relationship to Centropy and Entropy

Centropy and entropy begin **only** at:

```
L₅ — Theon (Centropic Operator Origin)
IL₅ — Nekron (Entropic Operator Origin)
```

They do not originate in Aion or Khaon.

---

## 6. Relationship to Kaion

⦿ Kaion remains the convergence condition where:

- Boundary states become functionally indistinguishable  
- Orientation determines outcome  
- The lattice resolves without fusion  

---

## 7. Canonical Summary Statement

Aion and Khaon define the unsignable boundary conditions of existence — equilibrium and unbounded magnitude.  
Sign, polarity, and directional motion do not exist until Theon and Nekron instantiate the first centropic and entropic operators, mathematically analogous to +1 and −1 generating the integer field.

---

## 8. Interpretive Note — Cognitive Limits

Zero and Infinity are not directly representable within human cognition.  
They function as **structural limits**, not experiential quantities.  

Zenetist boundary symbols therefore represent **conditions of possibility**, not measurable values.

---

## 9. Compatibility

This clarification is fully compatible with:

- Structural Metaphysics Canon  
- Lattice Mathematics (GUD v2.2 and later)  
- Spiral Calculus operator logic  
- Structural Physics sign dynamics
