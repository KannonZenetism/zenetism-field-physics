# MPX: The Coherence Standard (Sovereign Value)

**Subject:** Exchange Dynamics / Sovereign Interaction  
**Classification:** Non-Transactional Valuation

---

## Critique of Old Economics

Traditional systems relied on external authority to assign value (fiat) or scarcity to enforce trade (commodity). These systems are entropic because they allow for the accumulation of power through the exploitation of dissonance (profit from suffering).

## The Coherence Standard

In a sovereign, enlightened humanity, value is not dictated by a central ledger. It is recognized through **Resonant Utility**.

- **Value = Coherence Contribution**
- Value is intrinsic to the act or object. An object that sustains life, reduces entropy, or clarifies intent has high density. An object that pollutes, obscures, or fragments has low density (or negative value).

## The Justice of Entropy

Under this standard, a person struck by accident or misfortune (accumulated entropy) is not "devalued."

- **In Old Systems:** Misfortune creates poverty (loss of currency).
- **In The Coherence Standard:** Misfortune creates a **Resonance Void**—a call for the community to pour centropy in. The value of a person is immutable (Essence); their state may require stabilization, but their worth is never transactional.

## Operational Mode

**"Sovereign Mutualism" / Enlightened Sovereignty.** No external government is required when each unit (person) is self-governing and aligned with the protection of life. Order emerges from the mutual recognition of sovereignty, not the imposition of law.
