# MPX: The Three Horizons of Return  
## Structural Post-Mortem Outcomes

### Context

Not all ends are equal.  
Zenetism distinguishes between **Integration** (retaining structure), **Dissolution** (releasing structure), and **Collapse** (shattering structure).

The **Mercy Fold** is the middle horizon —  
the most common destination for the unintegrated yet benign soul.

It is not judgment.  
It is structural mercy.

### Trajectory Map

| Trajectory | State | Experience | Mechanism | Glyph |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|------|
| **Centropic Integration** | Acclivous | Continuity. The soul has built sufficient structural integrity (**DS / DM**) to retain self-awareness without embodiment. It continues as a Steward or aligned presence within the supernal arc. | **Crystallization** — the pattern is strong enough to hold its own frequency within Aion without collapse. | 💠🕊️◎ |
| **The Mercy Fold** | Neutral | Release. The soul lacks the coherence to maintain individual form but carries no heavy entropic load. It experiences a gentle unspooling — a soft sleep — as it is reabsorbed into the potential of Aion. | **Dissolution** — the pattern unties. Identity fades, but the energy is reclaimed through grace rather than fracture. | 🌫️🤲⚫ |
| **Entropic Collapse** | Declivous | Shattering. The soul is rigid, parasitic, or inverted. It resists return to Zero and experiences tearing, terror, and violent fragmentation as coherence fails (**Nekron / VOS**). | **Implosion** — the pattern fights the frequency of Source and snaps under tension. | 💔🕷️⚡ |

### Definition — Mercy Fold (MPX)

**Glyph:** 🌫️🤲⚫  

**Definition:**  
The tonal field of grace surrounding **Localized Dissolution**.

It is the energetic orientation of reabsorption without judgment.  
Unlike **Integration** (where the soul retains form) or **Nekron** (where coherence is crushed),  
the Mercy Fold is the **Soft Sleep**.

It occurs when a soul — too gentle for collapse yet too unformed for integration —  
is untied by the hands of Aion.

It is not punishment.  
It is the mercy of rest for those not yet ready to be eternal.
