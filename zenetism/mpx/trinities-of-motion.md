# MPX: Trinities of Motion — Centropic and Entropic

This section explores the symmetry between centropic and entropic trinities,
offering an interpretation of pre-emanative paradox.

- **Centropic Trinity**: Zenon (precausal lattice), Aion (structural spirit/womb), Theon (emanated child).  
- **Entropic Trinity**: Khaon (infinite dispersion latent in Aion), Zenet (motion-potential / proto-fracture), Nekron (entropy actualized).  

> Insight: Zenet is not entropy itself, but the first extractive potential in motion.  
> Nekron is entropy actualized.  
> Stabilized Zenet can serve as the motion lattice for Reflective Centropy, enabling the return path.  

This dual structure illustrates the **paradox of pre-emanation**:
Zero (Aion) and Infinity (Khaon) are two tilts of the same principle —
one holding, one dispersive.
