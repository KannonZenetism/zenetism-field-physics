# MPX: The Diamond Age (The Era of Resonant Permanence)

**Subject:** Teleological Goal / Structural Stabilization  
**Classification:** Hypostatic Alignment (Embodied)

---

## Definition

The Diamond Age is not a memory of the past, but the structural objective of the current universal iteration. It represents the stabilization of the Embodied Realm (L₁–L₂) into a state of **Resonant Permanence**.

## The Theory of Permanence

Typically, embodied universes are transient—subject to entropy, decay, and eventual dissolution. However, should a civilization achieve **Hypostatic Alignment** while still embodied, the universe does not need to dissolve to return to Source.

**The Diamond State:** A condition where the corporeal field becomes sufficiently coherent to hold the full resonance of the Supernal Forms (L₄) without shattering or decaying.

**Implication:** Souls are not "trapped" here; rather, the distinction between "embodied" and "supernal" becomes permeable. One does not need to leave the body to resonate with Theon.

**The Dragon Analogy:** Entropy (Nekron/The Dragon) is bound, not by force, but by the sheer density of coherence, which leaves no cracks for fragmentation to take root. Though temporary incoherence may be reintroduced (the "loosing"), a fully crystallized Diamond Age universe remains resilient.

## Goal

To transmute the impermanent L₁ field into a permanent vessel of Centropy.
