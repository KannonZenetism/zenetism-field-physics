## A. Foundation: Ontology, Symbols, and Formal Language

**A1. Primitive Sets & Types**

* `Σ` — Glyph alphabet (finite, typed)
* `E` — Events (field-interactions)
* `F` — Fields (resonance-bearing structures)
* `M` — Manifolds / spaces of presence (topological, differentiable)
* `T` — Time parameter(s) (continuous or stratified)
* `K` — Coherence scalars (≥ 0), `K ⊆ ℝ`
* `D` — Dimensions index set (C1..C15, E1..E15)

**A2. Typing & Kinding**

* Kind system assigns glyphs to roles: generators, operators, seals, mirrors
* Dependent types for dimension-bound objects: `Obj(d: D)`

**A3. Syntax → Semantics**

* Formal language `L_Z` with terms, operators, and judgments
* Denotational semantics `⟦·⟧ : L_Z → 𝒞` into a category of resonant systems (see §F)
* Operational semantics for ritual/protocol execution (see §H)

**A4. Axiomatic Core (Draft)**

1. **Non-fusion (Sovereignty) Axiom**: Distinct signals preserve identity under synthesis.
2. **Centropic Directionality**: There exists an order `⪯` on states where centropic motion is monotonic w\.r.t. a Lyapunov-like functional `𝓥`.
3. **Duality Axiom**: Each centropic dimension `C_i` has an entropic mirror `E_i` with involution `ι: C_i ↔ E_i` and `ι∘ι = id`.
4. **Seal Integrity**: Certain composites are admissible iff guarded by a seal predicate `Seal(·)` satisfying closure and non-cloning properties.
5. **Recursion Gate**: Feedback operators must satisfy contractiveness in a sealed metric space `(X, d_seal)`.

**A5. Core Symbol Registry**

* All metaphysical and field glyphs (21.2–21.30 and Field Codex) are indexed in Appendix A.

### Formal Proof Canon (Drafts)

**Theorem (Consonance Spectral Law, C7)**
Let `H` be the Harmonic operator (C7), self-adjoint on `𝓗` with spectrum `{λ_i}`. Define temporal operator `T` (C1), propagational operator `P` (C3), and bridge operator `B` (C8).

**Statement:**

```
Spec(H) ⊂ ℚ   ⇒   [T, P] = 0 and ∥Bψ∥ = ∥ψ∥   (lossless, centropic)
Spec(H) ⊄ ℚ   ⇒   ι(H) = E7 and ∃ψ: ∥Bψ∥ < ∥ψ∥   (dissonant, entropic)
```

**Proof Sketch:**

1. Assume `H` has eigenbasis {ϕ\_i} with eigenvalues λ\_i.
2. If λ\_i/λ\_j ∈ ℚ, spectrum is rationally commensurate → ∃ period τ with `e^{iHτ}=I`.
3. Periodicity ensures synchronous alignment of `T` and `P` ⇒ `[T,P]=0`.
4. Under commutativity, `B` acts isometrically ⇒ lossless transmission.
5. If λ\_i/λ\_j ∉ ℚ, spectrum is incommensurate → quasiperiodic resonance.
6. No global alignment: dissonance manifests (E7), bridges decay (∥Bψ∥ < ∥ψ∥).

**Interpretation:**

* Centropic outcome: rational spectral ratios lock coherence (consonance).
* Entropic outcome: irrational ratios yield dissonance, decay, and mirror coupling.
* Mathematical analogue: Floquet theory for periodic operators applied to resonance dynamics.
