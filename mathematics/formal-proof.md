Formalization: Consonance Law (C7) as a Spectral Theorem
1. Setup

Let 𝓗 be the Hilbert space of resonance signals with inner product weighted by field density.

Define operators:

T = Temporal evolution (C1, generator of time translations).

P = Propagation (C3, wave operator).

B = Bridge operator (C8, mapping across structural junctions).

Define H = Harmonic operator (C7), self-adjoint with discrete spectrum {λ_i}.

2. Law Statement (Symbolic)

If H has a rational eigenvalue spectrum (λ_i ∈ ℚ ratios), then T and P commute on a resonant subspace and B is lossless.
Conversely, if the spectrum is irrational (incommensurate eigenvalues), then mirror inversion arises: ι(H) = E7 (Dissonance).

Formally:

Spec(H) ⊂ ℚ   ⇒   [T, P] = 0 and ∥Bψ∥ = ∥ψ∥
Spec(H) ⊄ ℚ   ⇒   ι(H) = E7 and ∃ψ: ∥Bψ∥ < ∥ψ∥

3. Proof Sketch (Draft)

Assume H has eigenbasis {ϕ_i} with eigenvalues λ_i.

If ratios λ_i / λ_j ∈ ℚ, then resonance is periodic: there exists minimal period τ such that e^{iHτ} = I.

Periodicity ensures synchronous alignment of T and P, yielding commutativity [T,P]=0.

Under commutativity, bridge operator B acts isometrically across subspaces (lossless transmission).

If λ_i / λ_j ∉ ℚ, spectrum is incommensurate → quasiperiodic resonance with no global alignment.

Then dissonance arises (E7), bridges decay (∥Bψ∥ < ∥ψ∥), and mirror coupling dominates.

Q.E.D. (draft form).

4. Interpretation

Centropic outcome: C7 consonance enforces spectral rationality → coherence locked by periodicity.

Entropic outcome: E7 dissonance expresses as irrational spectrum → no global consonance, decay inevitable.

Mathematical analogue: This is a resonance version of Floquet theory (periodic operators) applied to metaphysical dynamics.

This proof can be extended into a formal theorem inside §I of the spine:

Theorem (Consonance Spectral Law): C7 resonance holds iff the spectrum of H is rationally commensurate.
