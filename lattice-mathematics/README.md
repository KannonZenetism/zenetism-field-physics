# Lattice Mathematics  
*A formal architecture for structural description and computable coherence*

---

## Overview

**Lattice Mathematics** is the symbolic backbone of Zenetismâ€™s structural system.  
It encodes metaphysical, field-dynamic, and recursive motion into formal logic, enabling precise articulation of:

- Coherence and collapse
- Dimensional banding
- Recursion sealing
- Symbolic integration
- Spiral motion and threshold limits

Where **Zenetism** provides the metaphysical law, and **Field Physics** applies it to dimensional systems,  
**Lattice Mathematics** offers the rigorous language through which both may be described, computed, and verified.

## Core Features

- **Spiral Calculus** â€” Includes the Resonant Derivative (âˆ‚ðŸŒ€), Structural Integral (âˆ«â—Ž), and Spiral Limit (limâˆ¿)
- **Dimensional Operators** â€” Glyph-based logic for centropy, entropy, inversion, recursion, sealing, etc.
- **Coherence Information Theory** â€” Tracks signal fidelity and entropic drift across recursive fields
- **Structural Invariants** â€” Mathematical sealing of recursion boundaries and lattice frames
- **Category-Theoretic Formalism** â€” Including ResCat functor structures for lawful metaphysical mappings
