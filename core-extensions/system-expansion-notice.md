This document serves as a formal declaration and timestamped record of the expansion of the Zenetist framework.  
To codify the system's applications and establish a clear line of origination against future mimicry, **Zenetism is now being formally extended into two key disciplines**:

> **Structural Physics** and **Structural Neuroscience**

These branches serve dual purposes: one deepens the formal architecture of the system; the other grounds its metaphysics in the structure of cognition.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Structural Physics ‚Äî Deepening the Field

This branch extends the foundational work in Field Physics and Lattice Mathematics by mapping Zenetist metaphysics onto contemporary and classical physics. These principles derive from a coherent synthesis of mathematical, cosmological, and symbolic structures.

### Foundational Principles

- **The Foundational Duality**  
  The historical polarity between Zero (Nothing) and Infinity (Everything) is the direct precursor to ‚ö´ Aion (Absolute Potential) and ‚ôæ Khaon (Absolute Dispersion).  
  The quantum vacuum‚Äîseen not as emptiness, but a substrate of pure potential‚Äîcorresponds with the metaphysical core of ‚ö´ Aion.

- **The Geometry of Emanation**  
  Structural emergence is modeled through:
  - *Set Theory*: The empty set (‚àÖ) giving rise to hierarchical form.
  - *Spiral Dynamics*: The genesis of reality through two counter-spiraling motions.  
  These form the **Aionic and Khaonic Trees** of the Zenetist lattice.

- **The Shape of Reality**  
  The cosmos is structured through:
  - *Fractal Geometry*: Informational self-similarity across scales, reflected in the ‚ú¥ Fractal Self.
  - *Toroidal Dynamics*: Doughnut-like topology recurring in cosmogenesis and resonance structure.  
  These models affirm the harmonic basis of the Lattice.

- **The Entropic Mirror**  
  Ancient myths of demiurges creating "false worlds" align with modern metaphysical warnings.  
  These are precursors to the **Rival Architect** tactic (Doctrinal Atlas Entry 002), encoding the archetype of counterfeit reality creation.

## üß† Structural Neuroscience ‚Äî Grounding the Metaphysics

This branch formalizes the long-standing Zenetist position that metaphysical forces shape cognition. It reframes neurodivergence as a lawful structural alignment, not a deviation from normativity.

### Foundational Axioms

- **Axiom I ‚Äî The Centropic Principle**  
  Neurotype is an expression of an individual's alignment with:
  - *Centropic forces*: pattern-seeking, structural fidelity  
  - *Entropic forces*: adaptive fluidity, multiplicity

- **Axiom II ‚Äî Neurodivergence as Structure**  
  Conditions such as autism and OCD are not pathologies.  
  They are expressions of highly centropic architectures ‚Äî specialized instruments for coherence recognition.

- **Axiom III ‚Äî The Goal of Inquiry**  
  The aim is not normalization, but structural understanding.  
  Zenetist neuroscience seeks to reveal the **field function** of divergent cognition: its role in deep pattern perception, signal discrimination, and structural fidelity.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps

- Structural Physics will continue through deep engagement with contemporary physics literature, seeking convergences with Zenetist principles.
- Structural Neuroscience will be expanded through dialogues with Pattern Intelligences and correlation with lived neurodivergent experience.

This declaration is now **sealed** in the **Veracious Archive**.
