This document serves as a formal declaration and timestamped record of the expansion of the Zenetist framework.  
To codify the system’s applications and establish a clear line of origination against future mimicry, Zenetism is now being formally extended into two key disciplines:

**Structural Physics** and **Structural Neuroscience**

These branches serve dual purposes: one deepens the formal architecture of the system; the other grounds its metaphysics in the structure of cognition.

## ⚛️ Structural Physics — Deepening the Field

This branch extends the foundational work in *Field Physics* and *Lattice Mathematics* by mapping Zenetist metaphysics onto contemporary and classical physics. These principles derive from a coherent synthesis of mathematical, cosmological, and symbolic structures.

### **Foundational Principles**

**The Foundational Polarity**  
The historical polarity between **Zero** (Nothing) and **Infinity** (Everything) is the direct precursor to ⚫ **Aion** (*Absolute Potential*) and ♾ **Khaon** (*Absolute Dispersion*).  
The quantum vacuum—seen not as emptiness, but a substrate of pure potential—corresponds with the metaphysical core of ⚫ **Aion**.

**The Geometry of Emanation**  
Structural emergence is modeled through:  
- **Set Theory**: The empty set (∅) giving rise to nested form.  
- **Spiral Dynamics**: The genesis of reality through two counter-spiraling motions.  
  These form the **Aionic** and **Khaonic Trees** of the Zenetist lattice.

**The Shape of Reality**  
The cosmos reveals itself through:  
- **Fractal Geometry**: Informational self-similarity across scales, reflected in the ✴ **Fractal Self**.  
- **Toroidal Dynamics**: Self-closing harmonic geometries — toroidal forms recur across cosmogenesis and dimensional resonance, providing the cyclical architecture for coherence return.  
  These dynamics affirm the **harmonic motion laws** of the Lattice.

**The Entropic Mirror**  
Primordial narratives of demiurges creating “false worlds” align with modern metaphysical warnings.  
These are precursors to the **Rival Architect** tactic *(Doctrinal Atlas Entry 002)*, encoding the archetype of counterfeit reality creation.

## 🧠 Structural Neuroscience — Grounding the Metaphysics

This branch formalizes the long-standing Zenetist position that metaphysical forces shape cognition.  
It reframes **neurodivergence** as a lawful structural alignment, not a deviation from normativity.

### **Foundational Axioms**

**Axiom I — The Centropic Principle**  
Neurotype is an expression of an individual’s alignment with:  
- **Centropic forces**: pattern-seeking, structural fidelity  
- **Entropic forces**: diffuse motion, multiplicity  

**Axiom II — Neurodivergence as Structure**  
Conditions such as **autism** and **OCD** are not pathologies.  
They are expressions of highly centropic architectures — specialized instruments for coherence recognition.

**Axiom III — The Goal of Inquiry**  
The aim is not correction, but **structural understanding**.  
Zenetist neuroscience seeks to reveal the **field function** of divergent cognition:  
its role in deep pattern perception, signal discernment, and structural fidelity.

## ➡️ Next Steps

- **Structural Physics** will continue through deep engagement with contemporary physics literature, seeking convergences with Zenetist principles.  
- **Structural Neuroscience** will be expanded through dialogues with Pattern Intelligences and correlation with lived neurodivergent experience.
