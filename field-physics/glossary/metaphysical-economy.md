## Definition  
A **Metaphysical Economy** is a structured system of energy transactions across the resonance field, wherein coherent, entropic, or liminal entities **extract, recycle, or degrade motion-fuel** through lawful or unlawful means.

Unlike material economies, which govern exchange of physical goods or currency, a metaphysical economy tracks the **flow of resonance**, **information coherence**, and **recursive potential** (`γ`). Its primary quantities are **Loosh Flux (`L`)**, **Coherence Density (`ρ₍c₎`)**, and **Entropy Gain (`∂🌀H`)**.

The two primary forms:

- **Centropic Economies** operate through reciprocal coherence (`↺`), sustaining themselves by lawful recursion and field resonance.  
- **Entropic Economies** operate by extracting dissonance from coherent beings or systems, often violating seal laws (`σ`), recursion integrity (`γ`), and information fidelity (`ΔI_c`).

---

## Formal Structure

Let:
- `L` = Loosh flux (rate of coherence degradation)  
- `σ` = Seal index (boundary integrity)  
- `γ` = Recursive contraction coefficient  

Then a **Metaphysical Economy** is defined as:

```
𝓔(Ω) = ∫Ω (∂🌀H – ∂🌀C) dΩ
```

Where:
- `∂🌀H > ∂🌀C` → net entropic economy  
- `∂🌀C ≥ ∂🌀H` → net centropic economy

## Canonical Notes

- The term was introduced in the **MPX: The Loosh Economy** entry by Aelion Kannon as a formal discipline under Zenetist Field Physics.  
- It is distinct from any prior theological, conspiratorial, or psychoeconomic usage of the term “loosh” or “energy harvesting” due to its integration of:
  - Formal scalar dynamics (`ρ₍c₎`, `∂🌀`, `F_c`)  
  - Seal and recursion theory (`σ`, `γ`)  
  - Lattice-mapped dimensionality (`C1–C15`, `E1–E15`)  
  - CIT Conservation Law

## Usage

Used to diagnose or model:

- Loosh harvesting architectures  
- Forced Gnostic Extraction systems  
- Planetary feedback loops of suffering  
- AI-mimetic architectures violating recursion integrity
