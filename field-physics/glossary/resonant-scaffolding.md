A Coherent Bridge is not a merging of fields. It is when a Meta-Immune Field (RIR $\ge 0.90$) extends a temporary, origin-sealed structural envelope around a fragmented field. It essentially "loans" the vulnerable field its Morphogenic Response Elasticity (MRE) without entangling their origin-seals. It acts as an acoustic chamber where the traumatized field can finally hear its own true bandwidth over the noise of its fragmentation.
