**Aionic Non‑Progression Axiom**

Aion does not accumulate coherence, evolve, or progress.  
Each universe is a finite emanation of potential, not a stage in a cosmic developmental sequence.  
Centropy refines essence, not the cosmos; entropy dissolves patterns, not the Lattice.  
The Lattice does not compound in coherence across universes; it persists as the structural architecture through which emanation occurs.

This axiom rejects teleological cosmology and affirms the non‑accumulative, non‑progressive nature of Aionic emanation.
