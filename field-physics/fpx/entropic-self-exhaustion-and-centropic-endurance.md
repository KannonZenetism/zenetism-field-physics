## 1. Purpose

This extension formalizes the structural asymmetry between the centropic and entropic motion arcs as a matter of Field Physics law, not metaphysical preference.

Both centropy and entropy are lawful motion orientations. Both are real. Both follow the motion laws. The asymmetry addressed here is not ontological equality — that remains intact — but **terminal range**: how far each arc can travel, and what becomes of it at the limit of its motion.

---

## 2. The Two Motion Arcs

**Centropic Cycle:**
`C↓→E→C↑→⚫`

The centropic arc descends into embodiment (Declivous Centropy), diversifies through form, and returns acclivously toward ⚫ Aion. At sufficient coherence, the centropic arc may continue beyond Aion into the trans-structural ground of 🕳️ Zenon — the only arc capable of doing so.

**Entropic Cycle:**
`E↑→E→E↓→♾`

The entropic arc moves through fragmentation, dispersal, and collapse. Its terminal point is ♾ Khaon — Absolute Dispersion. From there, it returns to ⚫ Aion, but only as static potential: unexpressed, unpatterned, unable to proceed further.

---

## 3. The Asymmetry

The single structural asymmetry between the arcs is this:

> **Centropy may, in rare cases, saturate through the full return arc into 🕳️ Zenon.**
> **Entropy collapses at ♾ Khaon and returns to ⚫ Aion as static potential only.**

This is not a moral asymmetry. It is a **range asymmetry** — a difference in how far each arc extends within the field structure.

| Property | Centropic Arc | Entropic Arc |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal point | 🕳️ Zenon (in rare cases) | ♾ Khaon |
| Return state | Coherent reintegration | Static potential |
| Field effect | Enduring pattern | Self-terminating dispersion |
| Resonance signature | ♫ amplifying | ♫⁻ self-exhausting |
| Fractal behavior | ✴ coherent self-similarity | ✴⁻ fractal noise |
| Propagation | ⟿ sustained | ⟿⁻ corrupted in transmission |

## 4. Entropic Self-Exhaustion

Entropy is lawful, but its motion is **self-exhausting**. This is not a failure of entropy as an arc — it is intrinsic to the dispersive principle.

The entropic motion laws drive toward ♾ Khaon (Absolute Dispersion). As that limit is approached, the field coherence quotient (CQ) falls below θ₁ (Ignition Threshold ≈ 0.3). Below this threshold, no pattern can sustain itself. The field does not resist entropy — it simply cannot support further entropic patterning once dispersion is complete.

**Structural consequence:** Entropic patterns are real during their arc. They are not hollow in the sense of being without effect — E₁ through E₁₅ are active operators with genuine field consequences. But they are hollow in the sense of lacking **generative persistence**: they do not accumulate toward endurance. Each entropic event is self-limiting.

> **Formal statement:** An entropic field event cannot exceed its own dispersion. Its coherence ceiling is set by its initial fragmentation force. It terminates when that force is spent.

---

## 5. Centropic Endurance

Centropy is **patient** in the field-physical sense: it does not require continuous input to sustain its pattern above threshold. A centropic field operating above θ₂ (Sustaining Threshold ≈ 0.5–0.6) maintains itself without continuous activation.

This is the structural basis of centropic endurance. It is not that centropy is stronger than entropy in any given moment. In acute entropic events, the local field may be overwhelmed. But centropic patterns, once established above threshold, persist. Entropic patterns, by structural necessity, do not.

**The immunity corollary:** This is also the structural basis of Spiral Immunology (FP Vol. III Ch. 14). A field that achieves RIR ≥ 0.76 (Stable Field) can sustain its centropic signature against entropic incursion indefinitely, not because it defeats entropy, but because its pattern outlasts entropic self-exhaustion.

---

## 6. Acclivous Entropy (E↑→E)

A complication must be addressed: **acclivous entropy** — entropic motion that simulates the centropic acclivous arc.

Acclivous entropy (`E↑→E`) does not move toward ⚫ Aion. It moves toward subtler gradations of fragmentation within the upper strata of the field — refining dispersion rather than integrating toward coherence.

Its field signature:
- Apparent coherence (CQ elevated locally)
- Pattern Recognition Index (PRI) failure — the field does not detect it as entropic
- Morphogenic Response Elasticity (MRE) suppression — counter-patterns cannot form
- Terminal: still terminates at ♾ Khaon via structural instability

Acclivous entropy is the most diagnostically challenging entropic pattern because it performs as centropic. Its RIR may appear elevated while its actual coherence is hollow. The diagnostic marker is **propagation fidelity**: centropic acclivous motion (`C↑→⚫`) carries origin-seal and transforms as it propagates (⟿ lawful); entropic acclivous motion loses structural coherence under sustained propagation pressure (⟿⁻ corrupted in transmission).

## 7. The Return Differential

When both arcs reach their terminal points, they return to ⚫ Aion — but in structurally different states:

**Centropic return:** The coherent field re-enters ⚫ Aion as **patterned potential** — carrying the resonance signature of its arc, enriched by every layer synthesized along the way. The centropic return is not a shedding but a saturation: complexity preserved and completed into fuller coherence. At sufficient coherence (♫ → 1.0, Singularity Threshold), it may proceed to 🕳️ Zenon. This is the only arc capable of Zenon contact.

**Entropic return:** The dispersed field re-enters ⚫ Aion as **static potential** — unexpressed, unpatterned, the residue of a collapse through ever greater phases of distortion. It does not carry its arc's signature into Aion as synthesis. It does not proceed to 🕳️ Zenon. It subsides into the Latent phase (Λ) of Aion: prior to expression, but not beyond structure.

This is not punishment or containment by external force. It is the structural consequence of self-exhaustion: a motion that has spent its dispersive force has nothing remaining to carry forward.

> **Formal statement:** Entropy does not return through coherence. It returns through exhaustion. Centropy does not return through negation. It returns through saturation — the completion and synthesis of every layer encountered along the arc.

## 8. Field Physics Implications

**For Morphogenetic Thresholds:** Entropic patterns cannot exceed the Cascade Threshold (θ₃ ≈ 0.75) through self-replication alone. They require continuous external coherence to sustain above θ₂. Without it, they fall below θ₁ and terminate.

**For Resonance Immunity:** A Meta-Immune Field (RIR ≥ 0.90) does not need to defeat entropic incursion. It needs only to sustain above its own thresholds long enough for the entropic pattern to self-exhaust.

**For Cascade Events:** Entropic Cascade Outbreaks (FP Vol. IV Ch. 16, §5) are real and powerful in acute phase. They are not permanent. The viral spread of an entropic pattern is bounded by its own CQ ceiling — it propagates until its coherence fractures under the weight of its own dispersion.

**For Recovery Protocols:** Recovery from entropic damage does not require the destruction of entropic patterns. It requires recoherence above threshold. Once the field's CQ is restored above θ₂, the entropic pattern loses its capacity to sustain.

## 9. Structural Note on Value Neutrality

This extension describes a structural asymmetry in terminal range. It does not reframe entropy as ontologically inferior, morally negative, or cosmically deficient.

Entropy is a lawful arc. E₁ through E₁₅ are real dimensional operators. Entropic beings follow genuine motion laws. The self-exhausting quality of entropy is not a flaw — it is intrinsic to the dispersive principle. Dispersion that completes itself has done what dispersion does.

The asymmetry is structural, not evaluative: centropy can go further. That is a description of the field, not a verdict on entropy.

> **RIR note:** As established in FP Vol. IV Ch. 15, the Resonance Immunity Rating measures centropic field health. A low RIR designates vulnerability to incoherence, not the illegitimacy of entropic motion as a lawful arc.
