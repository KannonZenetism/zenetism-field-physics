## 1. Purpose

The existing Field Physics metric system — Coherence Quotient (CQ), Pattern Recognition Index (PRI), Morphogenic Response Elasticity (MRE), and composite Resonance Immunity Rating (RIR) — measures centropic field health. These metrics are valid and operationally precise within their scope.

They are not entropic field metrics.

This extension formally specifies the **Incoherence Quotient (IQ)** as the parallel entropic field metric: a measurement of dispersive field intensity oriented toward ♾ Khaon rather than toward ⚫ Aion. IQ is not the inverse of CQ. It is a structurally distinct measurement of a structurally distinct motion arc.

---

## 2. The Problem with CQ Applied to Entropic Fields

The Coherence Quotient (CQ) was defined in FP Vol. IV Ch. 15 as:

`CQ = (∿ + ♫) ÷ ∑(⟠ + ◈)`

This measures alignment between a field's internal signal and external centropic patterns. Applied to an entropic field, CQ produces a structurally misleading result: it reads entropic field activity as low coherence — as if entropy were simply deficient centropy.

This is incorrect in two directions:

- An entropic field operating at full dispersive intensity is not "low coherence." It is operating at high IQ — high dispersive field intensity. Reading it as low CQ mischaracterizes its actual operative state.
- A centropically oriented field under entropic pressure may exhibit temporarily low CQ without being entropically oriented. CQ reduction and entropic orientation are not equivalent.

The IQ metric separates these two phenomena, allowing each to be measured on its own terms.

---

## 3. Formal Definition — Incoherence Quotient (IQ)

**IQ** measures the dispersive field intensity of an entropic motion arc. It is oriented toward ♾ Khaon: higher IQ indicates greater dispersive expression, greater fragmentation force, and deeper operative entropic intensity.

**IQ Formula:**

`IQ = (✴⁻ + ♫⁻) ÷ ∑(⟠⁻ + ◈⁻)`

Where:
- **✴⁻** = Fractal Noise operator intensity (E₅ — scaling patterns lacking coherence)
- **♫⁻** = Dissonance operator intensity (E₇ — harmonic breakdown)
- **⟠⁻** = Temporal Loop operator intensity (E₁ — recursive disorientation)
- **◈⁻** = Scatter operator intensity (E₂ — spatial de-coherence)

This formula mirrors the CQ structure while substituting the primary entropic operators for their centropic counterparts. It measures how actively a field is expressing dispersive motion across its temporal, spatial, scalar, and harmonic dimensions.

## 4. IQ Scale and Threshold Structure

Unlike CQ, which operates on a 0.00–1.00 scale anchored at centropic coherence, IQ operates on an **extended scale that includes negative values**.

This is structurally necessary: at the deeper subversal layers (IL₅ → IL₁ moving declivously toward ♾ Khaon), dispersive field intensity exceeds even the minimum threshold required for stable embodied expression. Negative IQ values do not indicate the absence of field activity — they indicate field activity below the minimum coherence floor for sustained pattern presence at a given layer.

**IQ Scale:**

| IQ Range | Classification | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00–0.25 | Latent Dispersion | Minimal entropic expression; field at low dispersive intensity |
| 0.26–0.50 | Active Dispersion | Entropic motion operative; fragmentation patterns active |
| 0.51–0.75 | Intensified Dispersion | High dispersive force; fragmentation self-reinforcing |
| 0.76–0.99 | Terminal Dispersion | Approaching dispersive limit; pattern integrity collapsing |
| 1.00 | Dispersive Limit | Maximum IQ; field at ♾ Khaon threshold; self-exhaustion imminent |
| < 0.00 | Subversal Extension | IQ below minimum embodiment floor; pattern presence unstable at current layer; characteristic of deep subversal operation (IL₄ → IL₅) |

> **Structural Note:** The subversal extension (IQ < 0.00) does not imply non-existence. It indicates that the field's dispersive intensity has exceeded the minimum coherence floor required for stable expression at its current layer. Fields in this range are not absent — they are operating at a level of fragmentation that destabilizes their own pattern substrate. This is the field-physical expression of the deepest entropic hypostatic layers (IL₄ / IL₅), where incoherence is not incidental but structural.

---

## 5. IQ and the Hypostatic Layer Structure

Entropic field expression varies by hypostatic layer. The IQ scale aligns with the inverse hypostatic arc as follows:

| Layer | Hypostasis | Characteristic IQ Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| IL₁ | Inverse Embodied Soul / Mind | 0.00–0.35 | Fragmentation at the embodied interface; reactive dispersion |
| IL₂ | Inverse Superficial Soul / Mind | 0.25–0.55 | Identity fragmentation; unstable or fragmentary presence |
| IL₃ | Inverse Deep Soul / Mind | 0.45–0.75 | Corrupted continuity; entropic pseudo-self |
| IL₄ | Inverse Deep Psyche / Logos | 0.65–0.99 | Subversal archetypes; authoritarian and deceptive patterning |
| IL₅ | Void of Self (Nekron) | 0.85–<0.00 | Maximum dispersive expression; subversal extension begins here |

> **Structural Note:** The IQ ranges above are operational approximations, not fixed boundaries. Entropic fields do not progress through layers in strict IQ sequence — layer position is a function of essential orientation and structural depth, not solely of IQ measurement. IQ measures dispersive field intensity at a given moment; layer position reflects the field's essential hypostatic mode.

## 6. Relationship Between IQ and CQ

IQ and CQ are **parallel metrics on distinct motion arcs**, not opposite ends of a single scale. This is the critical structural point:

- A field with high CQ (centropic, highly coherent) does not have low IQ. It has **no operative IQ** — it is not expressing dispersive motion.
- A field with high IQ (entropic, highly dispersive) does not have low CQ. It has **no operative CQ** — it is not expressing integrative coherence.
- A centropically oriented field under entropic pressure exhibits **reduced CQ** and may exhibit **locally elevated IQ** at specific dimensional bands where entropic incursion is active. Both readings are simultaneously valid and refer to different aspects of the field's state.

**The relationship between CQ and IQ vulnerability:**

Lower CQ in a centropic field increases susceptibility to entropic incursion — not because the field becomes entropic, but because reduced integrative coherence leaves more dimensional bands available for entropic operator activity. This is a **resilience differential**, not an **orientation differential**. Essence-as-Choice governs orientation; CQ governs resilience.

`Vulnerability to entropic incursion ∝ (1 - CQ)`

This is not an IQ measurement of the centropic field. It is a centropic resilience measurement that predicts susceptibility to external IQ pressure.

## 7. Composite Entropic Field Health Metric

Parallel to the RIR (Resonance Immunity Rating) for centropic fields, a composite **Dispersive Field Intensity Rating (DFIR)** can be specified for entropic fields:

**Component metrics:**

1. **Incoherence Quotient (IQ)**
   - Dispersive field intensity across primary E-operators
   - `IQ = (✴⁻ + ♫⁻) ÷ ∑(⟠⁻ + ◈⁻)`
   - Scale: 0.00 → 1.00 → <0.00 (subversal extension)

2. **Fragmentation Propagation Index (FPI)**
   - Rate of dispersive pattern propagation through contact fields
   - `FPI = (Transmitted ♫⁻) ÷ (Total E-operator Output)`
   - Scale: 0.00 (contained) → 1.00 (fully propagating)

3. **Dispersive Response Elasticity (DRE)**
   - The field's capacity to generate new fragmentation patterns after centropic counter-response
   - `DRE = (E-operator regeneration) ÷ (Centropic counter-pressure events)`
   - High DRE indicates a field that reconstitutes dispersive patterning rapidly after immune response

**DFIR Composite Formula:**

`DFIR = (IQ × 0.4) + (FPI × 0.3) + (DRE × 0.3)`

**Entropic Field State by DFIR Score:**

| Score Range | Classification | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00–0.25 | Latent Entropic Field | Minimal dispersive expression; entropy at low operative intensity |
| 0.26–0.50 | Active Entropic Field | Fragmentation patterns operative; dispersive arc engaged |
| 0.51–0.75 | Intensified Entropic Field | High dispersive force; fragmentation self-reinforcing |
| 0.76–0.89 | Terminal Entropic Field | Approaching dispersive limit; self-exhaustion accelerating |
| 0.90–1.00 | Dispersive Limit Field | Maximum DFIR; ♾ Khaon threshold; pattern integrity at terminal collapse |

> **Structural Note:** The DFIR scale measures dispersive field health on entropic terms — it does not evaluate entropic fields as deficient centropic fields. A DFIR of 0.90 is not a failing score; it indicates a field operating at near-maximum dispersive expression. Whether this constitutes field health or field collapse depends on the arc's position relative to the self-exhaustion threshold described in FPX — Entropic Self-Exhaustion and Centropic Endurance.

## 8. Relationship to Morphogenetic Thresholds

The morphogenetic thresholds (θ₁, θ₂, θ₃) specified in FP Vol. II Ch. 10 are centropic activation points. As clarified in the structural note added to that chapter, they describe the conditions under which centropic patterns activate, sustain, replicate, and achieve field permanence.

An entropic field approaching its dispersive limit does not cross θ₁, θ₂, or θ₃ in reverse. The morphogenetic threshold structure does not apply to the entropic arc in the same directional sense. The entropic arc has its own threshold structure:

| Entropic Threshold | IQ Approximate Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Ignition Threshold (φ₁)** | IQ ≈ 0.25 | Minimum dispersive intensity for entropic pattern activation |
| **Sustaining Threshold (φ₂)** | IQ ≈ 0.45–0.55 | Dispersive pattern sustains without continuous external input |
| **Cascade Threshold (φ₃)** | IQ ≈ 0.70 | Dispersive pattern begins self-reinforcing fragmentation |
| **Dispersive Limit (φ → 1.00)** | IQ → 1.00 | Pattern reaches maximum dispersive expression; self-exhaustion imminent |

The φ thresholds (phi) are designated separately from the θ thresholds (theta) to preserve the structural distinction between centropic and entropic activation sequences.
