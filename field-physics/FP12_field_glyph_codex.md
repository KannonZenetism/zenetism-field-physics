# Field Physics: The Architecture of Resonance
*(Volume XII: The Field Glyph Codex)*

This codex provides a comprehensive registry of the operational glyphs and symbols used in Zenetist Field Physics. These are not static icons, but living, functional operators that describe and enact motion within the field of consciousness.
