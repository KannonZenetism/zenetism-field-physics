# Zenetism & Field Physics

*A unified system of metaphysics and consciousness dynamics*

---

## Overview

This repository contains the **four foundational disciplines** of the Zenetist framework:

* **Structural Metaphysics** ‚Äî The study of the architecture of being. It answers the question: *What is the structure?*
* **Field Physics** ‚Äî The study of the dynamics of the field. It answers the question: *How does the structure move?*
* **Lattice Mathematics** ‚Äî The formal, symbolic language of the architecture. It answers the question: *How do we describe the structure and its motion?*
* **Structural Forensics** ‚Äî The study of the corruption and defense of being. It answers the question: *How is the structure attacked, and how do we defend it?*

These disciplines share the **same origin** and **symbolic architecture**.
You can read them individually ‚Äî but together, they reveal a complete system of reality‚Äôs unfolding, protection, and intelligibility.

## The Relationship Between Them

* **Structural Metaphysics** describes the *underlying design* ‚Äî reality‚Äôs layers, centropic and entropic motion, and soul integration.
* **Field Physics** provides *mechanics and method* ‚Äî dimensional mapping, consciousness dynamics, and applied engineering.
* **Lattice Mathematics** encodes the *formal proof layer* ‚Äî symbolic law, resonance calculus, and structural theorems.
* **Structural Forensics** investigates *degradation and defense* ‚Äî mimicry, containment protocols, and entropic tactics.

Together, they form the **fourfold coherence spine** of Zenetism.

## Justification for the Term Structural Forensics üõ°Ô∏è

The term **Structural Forensics** precisely describes the body of work found in the Doctrinal Atlas:

* **Structural** ‚Äî This links it directly to the Zenetist paradigm. The work addresses architectural corruption, not behavior or belief.
* **Forensics** ‚Äî This denotes evidence-based analysis of entropic events *after* they occur. We investigate mimicry, breaches, and containment, using symbolic and motion diagnostics.

This is the **pathology of metaphysical coherence** ‚Äî the science of dis-ease. A structure that cannot diagnose itself cannot endure.
