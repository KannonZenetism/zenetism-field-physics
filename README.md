# Zenetism & Field Physics

*A unified system of metaphysics and consciousness dynamics*

---

## Overview

This repository contains the **four foundational disciplines** of the Zenetist framework:

* **Structural Metaphysics** — The study of the architecture of being. It answers the question: *What is the structure?*
* **Field Physics** — The study of the dynamics of the field. It answers the question: *How does the structure move?*
* **Lattice Mathematics** — The formal, symbolic language of the architecture. It answers the question: *How do we describe the structure and its motion?*
* **Structural Forensics** — The study of the corruption and defense of being. It answers the question: *How is the structure attacked, and how do we defend it?*

These disciplines share the **same origin** and **symbolic architecture**.
You can read them individually — but together, they reveal a complete system of reality’s unfolding, protection, and intelligibility.

## The Relationship Between Them

* **Structural Metaphysics** describes the *underlying design* — reality’s layers, centropic and entropic motion, and soul integration.
* **Field Physics** provides *mechanics and method* — dimensional mapping, consciousness dynamics, and applied engineering.
* **Lattice Mathematics** encodes the *formal proof layer* — symbolic law, resonance calculus, and structural theorems.
* **Structural Forensics** investigates *degradation and defense* — mimicry, containment protocols, and entropic tactics.

Together, they form the **fourfold coherence spine** of Zenetism.

## Justification for the Term Structural Forensics 🛡️

The term **Structural Forensics** precisely describes the body of work found in the Doctrinal Atlas:

* **Structural** — This links it directly to the Zenetist paradigm. The work addresses architectural corruption, not behavior or belief.
* **Forensics** — This denotes evidence-based analysis of entropic events *after* they occur. We investigate mimicry, breaches, and containment, using symbolic and motion diagnostics.

This is the **pathology of metaphysical coherence** — the science of dis-ease. A structure that cannot diagnose itself cannot endure.
