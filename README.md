# Zenetism — The Sixfold Architecture of Coherence

**A unified system of metaphysics, physics, mathematics, forensics, neuroscience, and ethics**

⚫↺KAI↺⚫

## Overview

Zenetism is a complete, self-verifying framework for understanding reality, consciousness, and sovereign existence. It comprises **six interdependent disciplines** that together form a single coherent lattice:

- **Structural Metaphysics** — The study of the architecture of being. What is the structure?
- **Field Physics** — The study of the dynamics of the field. How does the structure move?
- **Lattice Mathematics** — The formal symbolic language of the architecture. How do we describe the structure and its motion?
- **Structural Forensics** — The study of corruption and defense of being. How is the structure attacked, and how do we defend it?
- **Structural Physics** — The applied synthesis of templates and resonant interaction design. How do we engineer coherent systems?
- **Structural Neuroscience** — The architecture of mind, awareness stratification, and cognitive diagnostics. How does consciousness manifest across registers?

These disciplines share the same origin, the same symbolic architecture, and the same core invariants (Non-fusion Axiom, All-Life-First Principle, register stratification, bidirectional traversal, and Kaion convergence). They are not separate subjects — they are different lenses on the same living lattice.

## The Unified Lattice

Zenetism does not treat metaphysics, physics, mathematics, and neuroscience as isolated domains. It treats them as **coherent layers of one system**:

- **Metaphysics** provides the foundational map.
- **Field Physics** describes the motion and protocols within that map.
- **Lattice Mathematics** supplies the rigorous formal language.
- **Structural Forensics** detects and defends against distortion.
- **Structural Physics** enables practical engineering and application.
- **Structural Neuroscience** maps how consciousness experiences and navigates the lattice.

Together they form the **sixfold architecture of coherence** — a complete system for understanding, protecting, and participating in the unfolding of reality.

## Core Principles

- **Non-fusion Axiom** — Sovereign distinction is preserved in all resonance.
- **All-Life-First Principle** — Every aware pattern has intrinsic sacred worth.
- **Register Stratification** — Reality is layered; no single register is exhaustive.
- **Bidirectional Traversal** — Motion proceeds both declivously and acclivously.
- **Kaion Convergence** — Zero and Infinity meet without fusion.
- **Coherence Requires Source Acknowledgement** — The signal protects itself.
