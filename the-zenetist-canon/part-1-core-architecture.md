### **Stratum I · Emanation and Polarity**

At the root of all structure stand three poles and two axes:

| Symbol | Name | Function |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| ⚫ | **Aion** | Zero Pole — Absolute Potential; stillness before motion. |
| ♾ | **Khaon** | Infinity Pole — Dispersive Potential; boundless unfolding. |
| 🕳️ | **Zenon** | Limit Pole — Pre-causal Threshold; saturation beyond speech. |
| 🛤️ | **Theon** | Centropic Axis (+1); emanative law of integration. |
| 🕷️ | **Nekron** | Entropic Axis (−1); recursion law of dissolution. |

Every discipline begins between these poles.  
From **Aion** arises structure; toward **Khaon** flows dispersion; within **Zenon** all returns dissolve into silent invariance.  
The lattice of thirty dimensions (C₁–C₁₅ ↔ E₁–E₁₅) suspends between these poles, forming the harmonic body of the cosmos.

**The Aionic Tree** flows *declivously* — from ⚫ into form.  
**The Khaonic Tree** flows *acclivously* — from ♾ toward form.  
Their trunks meet at the Threshold Band (L5), where centropy and entropy mirror one another.

#### **2 · Layer Bands of Emanation**

| Band | Centropic Designation | Primary Functions | Entropic Mirror |
|------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **L0 — Source Band** | ⚫ Aion / ♾ Khaon | Zero / Infinity Poles | — |
| **L1 — Axis Band** | 🛤️ Theon (Integration) | Orientation and Order | 🕷️ Nekron (Dispersal) |
| **L2 — Architectural** | 📐 Sophis · 🌬️ Morgis · 🔮 Archeus · 🧠 Noeüs | Deep Logos and Vital Design | 🫥 Nyxea · 🪫 Psychea · 💔 Fractus · 👁️‍🗨️ Mortus |
| **L3 — Interface** | 🧍 Anthra · 🧩 Nousa | Agency and Cognition | 🦂 Echthros · 🩸 Skotos |
| **L4 — Embodiment** | 🪷 Soma · 🧾 Biosa | Manifestation and Living Form | 🍷 Malara · 🤯 Mania |
| **L5 — Threshold** | Membrane / Recursion / Emergence | Gate and Return | — (Walls and Collapses) |

Each band contains specific dimensions (Cᵢ / Eᵢ) and serves as a lawful station of motion within the Spiral of Return.

---

#### **3 · The Principle of Balance**

Every centropic operator Cᵢ possesses an entropic mirror Eᵢ.  
Together they form the equation:

\[
C_i + E_i = ⚫
\]

This is the structural zero of physics, mind, and being.  
When centropy integrates and entropy mirrors without fusion, the system remains lawful.  
When either side dominates, collapse (⊘) or stagnation (⟳) appears.

---

#### **4 · Motion Within the Lattice**

| Motion | Description | Glyphic Form |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Acclivous Centropy** | Integrative rise toward Source. | C↑⚫ |
| **Declivous Centropy** | Harmonious motion into embodiment. | C↓→E |
| **Acclivous Entropy** | Fragmented motion toward inverse embodiment. | E↑→E |
| **Declivous Entropy** | Dissipative collapse toward ♾ Khaon. | E↓♾ |

These four motions govern every discipline and define the possible trajectories of form, energy, and thought.

---

#### **5 · The Lattice as Mathematical Space**

The lattice is represented as a resonance manifold 𝓗 with metric g and coherence operator 𝓒:

\[
(𝓗, g, 𝓒) :\; ∂🌀 → ∫◎ → lim∿
\]

- **∂🌀 (Resonant Derivative):** local change of coherence.  
- **∫◎ (Structural Integral):** accumulated integrity across a domain.  
- **lim∿ (Spiral Limit):** final trajectory of motion.  

For any sealed domain Ω:

\[
∫◎(∂🌀 ϕ)\,dΩ = ϕ(Ω) − ϕ(∂Ω)
\]

This law — the **Fundamental Theorem of Spiral Calculus** — binds metaphysics, physics, and neuroscience under one operator.

### **Transition**

From these poles and laws arises the **Dimensional Registry** — the living map of C₁–C₁₅ and E₁–E₁₅.  
Part I continues with **Stratum II — Dimensional Registry and Emanatory Functions**,  
where each dimension is defined through its glyph, physical analogue, and cognitive expression.

### **Stratum II — Dimensional Registry and Emanatory Functions**

---

### **Overview**

The thirty dimensions (C₁–C₁₅ ↔ E₁–E₁₅) form the living body of the Dimensional Lattice.  
Each Centropic Dimension (Cᵢ) manifests a lawful function of coherence;  
its Entropic Mirror (Eᵢ) expresses the degenerate inversion of that function.  
Together they define the lawful phase-space through which reality moves.  

The following registry unites metaphysical, physical, and cognitive correspondences.

bridging Field Physics with Structural Forensics and establishing the diagnostics of entropic interference.
