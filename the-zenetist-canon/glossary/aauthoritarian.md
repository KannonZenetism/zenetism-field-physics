### **Aauthoritarian (⟡0⟡)**

A stance within Zenetism describing a position *outside* the authority–obedience axis.  
Aauthoritarianism is neither antagonistic toward authority nor compliant with it;  
it treats authority as a non‑operative category rather than an opposing force.

In Zenetism, this reflects the system’s refusal to ground metaphysics in hierarchy,  
command structures, or legitimizing powers. Aion does not rule; Essence does not obey;  
and the architecture of expression is not organized around domination or submission.

Aauthoritarian ≠ anti‑authoritarian.  
It is not rebellion. It is irrelevance: authority has no metaphysical standing here.
