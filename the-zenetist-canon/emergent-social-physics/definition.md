# Emergent Social Physics

**Emergent Social Physics** is the canon-level domain within Zenetism that describes how collective order, value, and coordination arise naturally from coherence, sovereignty, and resonance among beings.

This domain does not introduce new axioms or foundational laws.  
It articulates **downstream consequences** of the six pillar disciplines when coherence is sufficient at scale.

Emergent Social Physics examines:
- how order precipitates without enforcement
- how value becomes non-transactional under resonance
- how separation and association remain lawful without coercion
- how governance structures appear only as compensatory responses to incoherence

The entries in this folder are **descriptive, not prescriptive**.  
They do not propose systems to be imposed or adopted.

They document what *emerges* when:
- beings are internally coherent
- sovereignty is mutually recognized
- centropic dynamics outweigh entropic extraction

In this sense, Emergent Social Physics is not political theory.  
It is **structural observation** — the social analogue of field dynamics.

Order is not designed here.  
It is observed.
