# Legacy MPX Folder

This folder contains early extensions to the Zenetist Structural Forensics framework.  
Originally labeled “MPX” (Metaphysics Extension), it has since been structurally superseded by discipline-specific extension folders:

- `/LMX` — Lattice Mathematics Extensions  
- `/FPX` — Field Physics Extensions  
- etc.

All files are retained here for timestamp and version integrity.
